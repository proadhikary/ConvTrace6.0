                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Good afternoon, Karen. How are you feeling today?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I'm feeling a bit anxious about my future, especially with my career change. I'm worried that no casino will hire me because of my age.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>I can imagine how frustrating and uncertain this must feel for you, Karen. It's common to feel concerned about your abilities to pursue your desired career, especially when you're facing unique challenges like ageism in the job market. Can you tell me more about what you think will happen if you don't get hired by a casino, and how that might impact your sense of identity and purpose?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think if I don't get hired, it would be devastating. It would mean that I've wasted my time and money on this degree, and that I'm too old to make a change. I'll feel like I've failed myself and my family. It's like, what's the point of doing something you love if you're not good enough or young enough? I'll start to question my abilities and wonder if I'm just being foolish for trying.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It's understandable that you're feeling a sense of pressure to prove yourself, especially since you're making a significant change in your life and investing in your education. Can you tell me more about what you think will happen if you don't get hired, and what that would mean for you in terms of your sense of identity and purpose?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think it would be like I'm stuck in a rut, and everything I've worked towards is for nothing. It would make me feel like I'm not good enough, and that I'm just too old to try new things. It's like, what's the point of even trying if I'm not going to be taken seriously? I'll start to question my own abilities and wonder if I'm just pretending to be something I'm not.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It's as if your sense of identity and purpose are deeply tied to your ability to pursue your desired career, and the fear of not being taken seriously is really weighing on you. Can you help me understand what you think would happen if you didn't get hired, and how that would impact your daily life and relationships?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think if I don't get hired, I'll feel like I'm stuck in a rut and that everything I've worked towards is for nothing. It would make me feel like I'm not good enough, and that I'm just too old to try new things. It's like, what's the point of even trying if I'm not going to be taken seriously? I'll start to question my own abilities and wonder if I'm just pretending to be something I'm not. It would also affect my relationships with my family, especially my spouse and children, because they would be disappointed in me and think I've failed.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like the pressure to prove yourself and the fear of not being taken seriously is really weighing heavily on you, Karen, and it's understandable given the unique challenges you're facing as a 79-year-old student pursuing a degree in casino management. Many people in your shoes would feel the same way, and it's not uncommon for older adults to experience feelings of inadequacy or self-doubt, especially when it comes to their career goals. Can you help me understand what specific aspects of being hired or not hired are causing you the most distress?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think the worst part is the feeling of being judged based on my age. It's like, I know I'm 79, and I know I'm older than most of the people I'm going to be competing with for jobs, but I'm still capable of doing the work. I'm still smart, I'm still knowledgeable, and I'm still passionate about my career. But it's like, no one gives me a chance because of my age. And that's what's really frustrating, because I feel like I'm being denied an opportunity to prove myself based on something that's out of my control.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It's no wonder that you're feeling so frustrated and disappointed, Karen, as you're being denied opportunities solely based on your age, which is certainly not a reflection of your capabilities or potential. Many older adults face similar challenges in the job market, and it's often a result of stereotypes and biases that can be hard to overcome. Research has shown that ageism is a real and pervasive issue, and it's not just limited to the workplace. It's important to recognize that these biases are not a personal reflection of your worth or value, but rather a societal issue that can be addressed through education and awareness. Would you like to explore some strategies for building your confidence and self-esteem, as well as ways to reframe your negative self-talk and focus on your strengths and abilities?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah, that would be really helpful. I feel like I'm constantly putting myself down and doubting my abilities, and it's hard to break out of that cycle. Sometimes I feel like I'm just pretending to be something I'm not, like I'm just going through the motions and pretending to be a college student, but really I'm just an old lady trying to relive her youth. It's hard to shake that feeling, and it's exhausting.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It's not uncommon for individuals in your situation to experience a sense of disconnection from their true self, especially when trying to navigate multiple identities and roles. Can you help me understand what you think would happen if you were to let go of the pressure to prove yourself and simply focus on being yourself, without the need to fit into a particular mold or expectation?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think if I were to let go of the pressure to prove myself, I would feel a huge weight lifted off my shoulders. I would be able to focus on my strengths and abilities, rather than my age or perceived limitations. I would be able to approach my career transition with a sense of excitement and curiosity, rather than anxiety and self-doubt. And I would be able to build meaningful relationships with others, rather than trying to prove myself to them.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It's fascinating to see how this pressure to prove yourself is impacting your daily life, Karen, and how it's affecting not just your sense of identity but also your relationships with others. Research suggests that when we're able to let go of the need to constantly prove ourselves, we're more likely to experience a sense of authenticity and self-acceptance. Would you like to explore what small steps you could take to start shedding some of these pressure-driven expectations and focus on being true to yourself?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think I've been so focused on trying to prove myself that I've lost sight of what I truly want. I want to be happy and fulfilled in my career, and I want to make a positive impact on others. If I can focus on those goals, rather than trying to prove myself to others, I think I'll be able to find more joy and satisfaction in my work.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It's interesting to note how this pressure to prove yourself has been tied to your sense of identity and purpose, and how letting go of that pressure could allow you to reconnect with your true values and desires. Can you help me understand what specific values or desires you think have been overshadowed by this pressure to prove yourself, and how you think you can start to prioritize those in your daily life?</div>

                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It's fascinating to see how your desire for control and certainty is playing out in your life, Karen, and how it's affecting your sense of identity and purpose. It's almost as if you're carrying the weight of your past experiences and the expectations of others on your shoulders, making it hard for you to move forward. Would you like to explore how you can start to release some of that weight and find a sense of freedom and flow in your life, rather than getting caught up in the need for control and certainty?</div>

Can you help me understand what you think your purpose is, and how you think you can start to align your daily actions with that purpose?</div>

                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>As you explore this idea of letting go of the need to prove yourself, I'm wondering if you're starting to notice any patterns or habits that might be contributing to this sense of disconnection from your true values and desires. Are there any specific situations or relationships that tend to trigger this need to prove yourself, and how do you think you might be able to reframe those situations to focus more on your own values and goals?</div>

                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're starting to tap into the idea that your sense of identity and purpose are deeply connected to your values and desires, rather than external validation. That's a powerful realization. I'd like to build on that by exploring how you can start to prioritize your own needs and desires in your daily life. Can you think of one small, specific action you could take today or this week that would align with your values and desires, even if it's just taking a few minutes for yourself to breathe or go for a walk?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think I can start by focusing on my own strengths and abilities, rather than comparing myself to others or worrying about my age. I can remind myself that I'm capable and knowledgeable in my field, and that my passion and dedication will shine through in my work. I can also start by setting small, achievable goals for myself, like completing a project or attending a networking event, and celebrate my successes along the way. By doing so, I can start to build my confidence and self-esteem, and focus on my own strengths rather than trying to prove myself to others.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're recognizing the importance of focusing on your own strengths and abilities, rather than getting caught up in the fear of not being taken seriously due to your age. Can you help me understand how you think you can start to separate your self-worth from the opinions of others and focus on building your confidence and self-esteem?</div>

                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>As we move forward, I want to emphasize that it's essential to recognize that your self-worth and identity are not defined by the opinions of others, but rather by your own values, strengths, and passions. By focusing on your inner self, you'll be better equipped to navigate situations where you might feel pressured to prove yourself. Can you tell me more about what specific values and strengths you've identified as essential to your sense of self-worth, and how you think you can start to integrate those into your daily life and career search?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think it's become clear that I've been putting too much pressure on myself to prove myself, and that's led to a lot of negative self-talk and self-doubt.
