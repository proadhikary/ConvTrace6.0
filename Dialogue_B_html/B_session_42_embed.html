                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Hi Christopher, welcome. How are you feeling today?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I just feel like no matter what I do, I'm never going to get a job. It's like I'm stuck in this endless loop of rejections and it's really hard to stay motivated.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're feeling really stuck and frustrated about the job search process, and that it's taking a toll on your motivation. Can you tell me more about what's going on for you when you're applying for jobs and not getting any responses? What's the specific thought pattern that's leading you to feel like you're in this endless loop of rejections?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah, I mean, it's just like, every time I apply for a job, I'm convinced that I'm going to get rejected. And it's not just about the job itself, it's about the whole process. I feel like I'm just wasting my time, and that I'm never going to be good enough for anyone. It's like, I'm just not worthy of a job.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like this narrative of unworthiness has been a long-standing one for you, Christopher, and it's affecting your daily life in significant ways. Can you help me understand how you've been coping with these feelings, and what you think might be the most helpful step for you to take in order to start shifting this pattern of negative self-talk?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Honestly, I don't think anything can help me. I've tried everything, and nothing seems to work. I'm just stuck in this cycle of rejection and self-doubt, and I don't know how to break free from it.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>I can really sense how frustrating and demoralizing this situation is for you, Christopher. It's like you're stuck in a rut and don't know how to get out of it. Normalizing your experience, it's common for people to feel like they've hit a dead end and don't know what to do next. However, I'd like to explore the idea that sometimes, what we think is the end of the road might actually be a turning point. Would you be open to exploring some alternative perspectives on your job search and potentially finding a new path forward?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I don't know... I just feel like I've exhausted all my options and I've been trying for so long, but nothing seems to work. It's hard for me to imagine that things could change or that I could find a new path forward.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're carrying a heavy emotional weight from the prolonged period of unemployment and rejection, and it's natural to wonder if you've reached the end of the road. Can you help me understand what's driving your sense of exhaustion and hopelessness about your job search? What specific thoughts or feelings keep popping up for you, and how have they been impacting your daily life?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I feel like I've just been beating myself up over this for so long, and I'm just so tired of feeling like I'm not good enough. I'm tired of applying for jobs and getting rejected, and I'm tired of feeling like I'm stuck in this rut. It's like, I just want to be able to get a job and start my life already, but it feels like it's just out of reach. And even when I do get a rejection email, it's like, I just feel like I'm not worthy of a job, like I'm just not good enough. It's really hard for me to shake that feeling off.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like this heavy burden of self-doubt is weighing heavily on you, Christopher, and it's understandable that you're struggling to see a way out of this cycle. I want to acknowledge that it takes a lot of courage to acknowledge these feelings, and I'm here to support you in exploring ways to shift your perspective. Can you help me understand what's been the most difficult part of this experience for you, and what would make it feel more manageable to you?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I guess what's been the hardest part is just feeling like I'm running out of options and that I've tried everything. It's like, I've applied to so many jobs, and I've networked, and I've taken classes, and I've done all these things that I'm supposed to do, and it's just not working. And it's hard for me to see a way out of this, because it feels like I've exhausted all my options.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>I think it's really important to acknowledge that the feeling of desperation and frustration is not only valid but also understandable, given the prolonged period of unemployment and rejection you've faced. At the same time, I'd like to gently challenge the idea that you've exhausted all your options. By reframing your approach and exploring new ways to look at your job search, we might be able to uncover some new paths forward. What are some things that you enjoyed doing in your previous roles or in your free time that might translate to a new career or job search strategy?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I guess I never really thought about that. I mean, I used to love designing digital art, and I've always been pretty good at it. Maybe I could explore that as a career path? But then again, I'm not sure if that's even relevant anymore. It's been so long since I've done anything creative...</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It's really interesting to hear how your passion for digital art has been simmering beneath the surface, and I'm curious to explore how it might be related to your current job search struggles. Can you tell me more about what you think your creative expression would look like in a professional setting, and how you envision it contributing to your overall sense of fulfillment and motivation?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>It's hard for me to imagine that designing digital art could be a viable career path, especially since it's been so long since I've done anything creative. But hearing you say that might actually be a good way to break out of this cycle of negativity and self-doubt. I suppose it's worth exploring, but I'm still worried that it's not going to lead to a job or that I'm just fooling myself.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're caught between the desire to explore your creative side and the fear of disappointment and rejection. I'm curious, what would be the smallest, most manageable step you could take to start exploring this creative outlet again, and what would be the worst that could happen if you took that step?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think what's been holding me back from exploring my creative side is the fear of failure and rejection. What if I spend all this time and effort into designing digital art and nobody wants to hire me? What if it's not good enough? Those thoughts are really scary for me, and it's hard for me to imagine taking a step forward when I'm so worried about the outcome.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like the fear of failure and rejection has been a major obstacle for you in pursuing your creative interests, Christopher. By acknowledging and exploring this fear, we can start to break it down and understand what's driving it.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah, I guess I understand what you're saying. I never really thought about it that way. But it's hard for me to shake off the feeling that I'm just not good enough. I keep thinking that if I just work harder, I'll be able to get a job. But even when I do work hard, nothing seems to happen. It's like, I'm just stuck in this cycle of rejection and self-doubt, and I don't know how to break free from it.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're carrying a lot of emotional weight with you, Christopher, and it's normal to feel like you're at a crossroads. Your pet dog's presence in your life seems to be a source of comfort, but I'm also wondering if you're using their affection as a way to distract yourself from the stress and anxiety of your job search. Can you help me understand how you think they're affected by your struggles, and if you're worried about their well-being if you're not able to find a new job soon?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I don't know, I just feel like I've been so focused on my job search for so long that I haven't really thought about how my dog is doing. I guess I just assumed that they're okay because they're always around me. But now that you mention it, I do worry about how they're affected by my stress and anxiety. I mean, I know they can sense when I'm upset or worried, and it's like, I'm trying to be strong for them, but at the same time, I'm worried about what would happen to them if I couldn't take care of them anymore.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're shouldering a significant emotional load, and I want to acknowledge that it's okay to feel overwhelmed by the weight of responsibility for your pet dog's well-being. At the same time, I'm curious to understand how you're currently taking care of yourself, not just your dog, during this challenging time. Can you tell me more about what self-care practices you've been incorporating into your daily routine, and how you've been prioritizing your own physical and emotional well-being?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think I've been neglecting my own self-care a lot lately. I've been so focused on applying to jobs and finding a new career path that I haven't really taken the time to prioritize my own well-being. I've been sleeping in late, skipping meals, and just kind of going through the motions of daily life without really taking care of myself. And it's like, I know that's not sustainable, but I just feel so overwhelmed by the job search process that I don't know how to slow down and take care of myself at the same time.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Christopher, it sounds like you're carrying a heavy emotional load, and it's no wonder you're feeling stuck and overwhelmed. It's as if you're caught in a cycle of self-doubt and rejection, and it's taking a toll on your physical and emotional well-being. I want to gently challenge you to consider that your self-care is not a luxury, but a necessity to sustain yourself during this challenging time. By prioritizing your own well-being, you'll not only feel more grounded and centered, but you'll also be more equipped to tackle your job search with renewed energy and motivation. What do you think would be the smallest, most manageable step you could take today to show up for yourself and start building your emotional resilience?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I'm not sure... I just feel like I've been beating myself up over this for so long, and I'm just so tired of feeling like I'm not good enough. I'm tired of applying for jobs and getting rejected, and I'm tired of feeling like I'm stuck in this rut. It's like, I just want to be able to get a job and start my life already, but it feels like it's just out of reach.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're carrying a heavy emotional burden, Christopher, and it's understandable that you're feeling exhausted and demoralized. I want to acknowledge that your desire to break free from this cycle of self-doubt and rejection is a powerful motivator, and I'm here to support you in finding ways to shift your perspective. Can you help me understand what specific thoughts or feelings come up for you when you think about reframing your creative expression as a form of self-care, rather than just a potential career path? What's the part of you that's holding you back from exploring this new approach and trying to find some sense of fulfillment and purpose in the process?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I guess I'm just really worried that if I start to focus on my own well-being and self-care, I'll be abandoning my job search efforts and giving up on finding a job. It feels like if I put my own needs first, I'll be neglecting my responsibilities and letting others down.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like the weight of your responsibilities is not only affecting your job search but also your relationship with your pet dog, and that's a big concern. Can you help me understand what would happen if you were to take a few small steps towards prioritizing your own self-care, not as a replacement for your job search, but as a way to sustain yourself during this challenging time? How do you think prioritizing your own well-being could actually help you approach your job search with renewed energy and motivation, rather than feeling drained and depleted?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I've been feeling so overwhelmed by the job search process and the constant rejection that I've started to feel like I'm not good enough. I've been trying to convince myself that I'm worthy of a job, but it feels like no matter what I do, I'm never going to get one. It's like, I'm just stuck in this cycle of self-doubt and rejection, and I don't know how to break free from it.</div>

How do you think this shift in perspective could impact your overall sense of well-being and motivation in your job search?</div>

                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're carrying a significant emotional burden, Christopher, and it's understandable that you're struggling to find a balance between your job search and your own well-being. I want to gently challenge the idea that taking care of yourself is a luxury or a selfish act. By prioritizing your own well-being, you're not abandoning your job search, but rather, you're giving yourself the tools and energy to approach your job search with renewed motivation and focus. Can you help me understand what specific thoughts or feelings come up for you when you think about reframing your job search as a process of discovery, rather than just a means to an end? How do you think this shift in perspective could impact your overall sense of well-being and motivation in your job search?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I'm starting to feel a bit overwhelmed by all the negative thoughts and feelings I've been having.

I'm tired of feeling like I'm not good enough, and I'm worried that I'll never be able to break free from this cycle of self-doubt and rejection. It's like, I'm just so tired of feeling stuck and hopeless.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>As you're exploring this idea of reframing your job search as a process of discovery, rather than just a means to an end, I want to acknowledge that it can be challenging to let go of the pressure to find a job quickly and start your life. Can you help me understand what would happen if you were to give yourself permission to take a more slow and intentional approach to your job search, one that's focused on building your skills and confidence, rather than just rushing to find a job? How do you think taking this approach could impact your overall sense of motivation and energy in your job search, and perhaps even in your relationship with your pet dog?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>It's hard for me to imagine that I could actually take a step back and focus on my own well-being, instead of just pushing forward with the job search. I feel like I've been running on autopilot for so long, and it's exhausting. But at the same time, I'm worried that if I start to prioritize my own needs, I'll be neglecting my responsibilities and letting others down. It's like, I'm stuck in this cycle of guilt and shame, and I don't know how to break free from it.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It seems like you're struggling to balance your responsibilities with your own needs, Christopher, and that's a really common experience. I want to acknowledge that it's okay to feel overwhelmed and that taking care of yourself is not a selfish act, but rather a necessary one to maintain your physical and emotional well-being. By prioritizing your own self-care, you're not abandoning your job search or your relationship with your pet dog, but rather, you're giving yourself the tools and energy to approach these areas with renewed motivation and focus. Can you help me understand what specific self-care activities or practices you think might be helpful for you right now, and how you could realistically incorporate those into your daily routine?</div>

Can you help me understand what would happen if you were to take a step back and focus on building your confidence and skills, rather than just pushing forward with the job search?
