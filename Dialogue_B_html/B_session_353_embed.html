                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Hi Courtney, it’s nice to meet you. What brings you in today?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I’ve been feeling really irresponsible and am constantly criticizing myself, especially when it comes to taking care of my cat.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It's not uncommon for people to experience a sense of self-criticism when they're feeling overwhelmed or responsible for the well-being of others, and it sounds like you're beating yourself up over not being able to provide the perfect home for your cat. Can you help me understand what you think would make you feel more in control and less critical of yourself in these situations?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I don't know, it's like I'm just stuck in this cycle of self-doubt and negativity. I feel like I'm not good enough, and that I'm just going to mess things up no matter what I do.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're carrying around a lot of self-doubt and negative self-talk, and that's really weighing on your mental health. Can you help me understand what you think would happen if you were to let go of some of that self-criticism and instead focus on being present with your cat? Would that feel like a small step towards taking control of your emotions and thoughts, or is there something else that's holding you back from making that change?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I don't think I can just let go of all this self-criticism. It's like it's a part of who I am now. And even if I try to focus on being present with my cat, I'll just end up feeling guilty for not doing everything perfectly. It's just so hard for me to accept that I'm not good enough.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It's interesting that you mention self-compassion as something you struggle with, and it's clear that this is a big part of your experience. Can you help me understand what you think would happen if you were able to practice self-compassion with yourself, especially in moments when you're feeling overwhelmed or disappointed? How might that change your relationship with yourself and with your cat?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I don't know, it's just hard for me to imagine being kind to myself when I feel like I've failed in some way. It sounds silly, but I feel like I'm not even worthy of compassion, let alone self-compassion.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It's interesting that you bring up the idea of being worthy of compassion, because often when we struggle with self-compassion, it's because we have a hard time believing that we're worthy of kindness and understanding. Can you help me understand what you think it would take for you to start to feel like you're worthy of compassion, not just from others, but from yourself?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I don't know, it just feels like I've been so negative and critical for so long that I don't know how to stop it or even if I'm even capable of being a more compassionate person. I feel like I've lost touch with what it means to be kind to myself, and I'm not sure how to get that back.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're carrying a heavy burden of self-criticism and negative self-talk, and it's affecting your ability to connect with yourself and your cat in a meaningful way. Research has shown that self-compassion can have a positive impact on mental health outcomes, including reducing symptoms of depression and anxiety. Would you be open to exploring some strategies for practicing self-compassion, such as acknowledging and accepting your imperfections, and treating yourself with kindness and understanding?</div>

                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It's as if you're stuck in this cycle of self-doubt and negativity, and it's really hard to break free from it. Many people struggle with similar feelings of inadequacy and self-criticism, and it's not necessarily a reflection of their worth or abilities. Would you be willing to explore some strategies to help you build self-compassion and mindfulness, such as keeping a journal or practicing mindfulness exercises?</div>

I guess I'm just worried that if I start to be kind to myself, I'll just feel guilty for not being good enough or for making mistakes.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It's really common to feel stuck in this cycle of self-criticism and negativity, and it's often a result of our underlying beliefs about ourselves and our worth. Can you help me understand what you think would happen if you were to challenge some of these negative self-talk patterns and start practicing self-compassion? For example, what if you were to acknowledge that it's okay to make mistakes and that they're a natural part of the learning process?</div>
