                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Hello, Nick. I'm glad you're here today. How are you feeling?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I've been feeling really isolated and it's hard to shake off this label of being a geek just because I'm good at science. It's like no matter what I do, that's all people see.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It's interesting that you mention feeling like you're stuck in this stereotype, and I want to acknowledge that it can be really frustrating and demoralizing to feel like you're being reduced to just one aspect of yourself. Can you tell me more about what you think would happen if you were able to break free from this label and explore other parts of yourself, like your interests or values? How do you think that would impact your relationships and overall sense of self?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I don't know, it's hard to imagine. I've been so focused on trying to fit in and avoid being seen as a geek that I don't even know who I am outside of that label. I feel like I'm just a science nerd, and that's all I'll ever be.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It's interesting that you bring up the idea of being a science nerd, Nick, and how that's led you to feel like you're missing out on other aspects of yourself. Can you tell me more about what specifically happens when you're around others, or in social situations, that makes you feel like you're stuck in this one dimension of your identity?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah, it's like, when I'm around others, I just feel like they're all looking at me, judging me, thinking I'm a total nerd. And even if I try to engage in conversations that aren't about science, I feel like I'm just pretending to be someone I'm not. It's all just so exhausting, and I don't know how to be myself without being labeled as a geek.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>I can totally see how that would be really overwhelming and tiring, Nick. It sounds like you're carrying around a lot of self-doubt and uncertainty about who you are and how others perceive you, and that can be really heavy to bear. Can you help me understand what you think would happen if you were able to let go of this need to fit in and just be yourself, without apology or explanation? What would that look like for you, and how do you think it would affect your relationships and overall sense of self?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I don't know if I can ever be myself, because I'm so used to trying to fit in and avoid being judged. It feels like I've been living a lie, pretending to be someone I'm not, just to avoid being labeled as a geek. I'm not even sure who I am outside of that label.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you've been carrying around a heavy burden of self-doubt and uncertainty for a while, and it's really impacting your daily life and relationships. Can you tell me more about what you think would happen if you were able to break free from this label and start living authentically? What would that look like for you, and what are some small steps you could take to start moving in that direction?</div>

It sounds like you're starting to realize that this label has been a heavy burden for you, and it's hard to imagine a life where you can be more than just a science nerd. Can you tell me what you think would happen if you started to explore other parts of yourself, like your interests or values, and how that might impact your relationships and overall sense of self?</div>

I'm scared to take the first step towards being myself, because I'm afraid of being rejected or judged.</div>

                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It's fascinating to see how this label has become such a deeply ingrained part of your identity, Nick. Can you help me understand what you think would happen if you were to start to separate your sense of self from your interest in science? Would you be worried about losing that part of yourself, or do you think it could actually help you connect with others on a deeper level?</div>
