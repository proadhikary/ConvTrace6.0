                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Hi Blake, welcome. I understand you're going through a rough time right now. Can you tell me more about what's been happening and how you're feeling?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>It's been tough because going to concerts means a lot to me. The thought of not being able to experience live music again is really overwhelming. I can't seem to shake off the fear that these events will keep getting canceled.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>I can imagine how unsettling this uncertainty must be for you, and it's interesting that you mention the sense of freedom and joy that live music events bring. Can you help me understand more about what specifically makes those feelings so important to you? Is it the sense of community and connection with others, or is it the emotional release you feel during and after the event? By exploring this further, we may be able to find ways to maintain that sense of joy and connection even if concerts don't return to normal.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think it's a combination of both, to be honest. I love the feeling of being part of a crowd, singing along to my favorite songs, and just losing myself in the music. It's like a release from all my worries and stress. But it's also the sense of anticipation and excitement that comes with waiting for a new album or a band's next tour. It's like, I'm looking forward to something, and it gives me a purpose.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>As you've shared, the uncertainty around live music events is not only affecting your excitement and anticipation but also your sense of identity and community. It's as if the experience of attending concerts has become intertwined with your sense of self and belonging. Can we explore this idea further? What do you think it would mean to you if the live music scene were to change permanently, and how would that impact your sense of purpose and belonging?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think it would be really tough for me to adjust to a world where concerts aren't a thing anymore. It's like, concerts are a part of who I am, you know? It's a way for me to express myself and connect with others who share similar interests. If that's taken away, it would be like a part of me is missing. I would have to find new ways to express myself and connect with others, and that would be really hard for me. It's not just about the music, it's about the experience and the memories I've made with friends and family.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It makes sense that the thought of losing this part of your life would be so distressing, given how deeply it's woven into your sense of identity and connection with others. Can you help me understand what it is about the idea of finding new ways to express yourself and connect with others that feels so overwhelming to you right now? Is it the fear of losing that sense of community, or is there something else that's holding you back from exploring alternative ways to engage with music and others who share your passion?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think it's a mix of both, actually. I'm scared of losing that sense of community and connection, but I'm also not sure what those alternative ways would even look like. I feel like I've invested so much of myself in this idea of attending concerts and festivals, and I'm not sure how to adapt to a new reality where those things aren't an option. It's like, I've built my identity around this experience, and I'm not sure who I would be without it.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>As you've shared, it's clear that this aspect of your life has brought you a sense of joy and fulfillment, and it's natural to feel a sense of loss and uncertainty about what the future might hold. Can you help me understand what you think would be the most difficult part of letting go of this aspect of your life? Is it the fear of not being able to recapture the same sense of connection and community, or is it something else entirely?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think the most difficult part would be the sense of loss and grief that comes with letting go of something that has been such a big part of my life. It's not just about the concerts themselves, but all the memories and experiences I've had with friends and family. If I were to let go of that, it would feel like I'm losing a part of myself, and that's a really scary thought.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like the thought of letting go of this aspect of your life is deeply tied to a sense of loss and grief, and it's natural to feel that way. Many people have a strong attachment to certain experiences or activities that bring them joy and a sense of identity, and it can be difficult to imagine a life without those things. Can you help me understand what you think you would need to feel supported and comforted during this process of letting go? Would it be helpful to have a ritual or a way to acknowledge and honor the memories and experiences you've had with friends and family?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think having a way to acknowledge and honor those memories would be really helpful. Maybe we could write down all the memories and experiences I've had at concerts and festivals, and then do a ritual to let go of that aspect of my life. That way, I can still hold onto the good times and the connections I've made, even if the concert scene changes.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're really drawn to the idea of writing down your memories and experiences, and then doing a ritual to let go of that aspect of your life. By putting your thoughts and feelings into words, you're creating a tangible record of those experiences that you can return to whenever you need to. And by doing a ritual to let go of that aspect of your life, you're acknowledging that change is inevitable, but you're also honoring the impact those experiences have had on you. Can you tell me more about what you think the most meaningful or effective way to do that ritual would be, and how you envision it helping you process your loss and grief?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think a ritual could be really powerful for me. Perhaps we could create a memory book with pictures and notes from all the concerts and festivals I've attended. Then, we could have a small ceremony where I write a letter to myself about the memories and experiences I've had, and then let go of the book in a symbolic way, like by setting it on fire or releasing it into the water. That way, I can still hold onto the memories, but I can also acknowledge that this chapter of my life is coming to a close.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like the idea of releasing the memory book into the water has a special significance to you, and I'm curious to understand what you think it would mean to you if you were to do so. Would it be a way of acknowledging the impermanence of things, or would it be a symbol of embracing change and moving forward?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think it would be a symbol of embracing change and moving forward. For me, the memory book represents a tangible connection to my past, and by releasing it into the water, I'm acknowledging that I can't hold onto it forever. It's like, I'm letting go of the past and embracing the present, even if that means things will never be the same again.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>As you consider the idea of releasing the memory book into the water, I sense a sense of ambivalence within you. On one hand, it seems like a powerful way to acknowledge the end of an era and let go of something that's no longer sustainable. On the other hand, it's also a tangible connection to the past, and it might be difficult to imagine what the future of music and connection will look like without the structure and routine of attending concerts and festivals. Can we explore what you think it would mean to you to hold onto the memories and emotions associated with those experiences, while also acknowledging the impermanence of the live music scene?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think it's interesting that you mention ambivalence, because I do feel that way. On one hand, I'm excited to explore new ways of connecting with music and others who share my passion, but on the other hand, I'm scared of losing the sense of community and identity that comes with attending concerts and festivals. It's like, I'm torn between embracing change and holding onto the past.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>As you explore this complex inner conflict, it's clear that you're grappling with the tension between holding onto what's familiar and embracing the unknown. I want to acknowledge that it's okay to feel uncertain and ambivalent about this change, and that it's natural to want to hold onto the memories and emotions associated with the live music scene. Can you tell me more about what specifically is calling to you about the idea of creating a digital archive of your memories or finding ways to stay connected with others who share your passion for music? What do you think would be the most meaningful way to honor and acknowledge the past while still being open to new possibilities?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think what's calling to me about the idea of creating a digital archive of my memories is the sense of preserving something that's important to me. It's like, even if I can't hold onto the tangible memories, I can still hold onto the emotions and experiences that those memories evoke. And I think that would be really powerful for me, to have a way to reflect on those memories and emotions whenever I need to.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>As you're considering the idea of creating a digital archive of your memories, I want to acknowledge that it's a complex and multifaceted process. It's not just about preserving the memories themselves, but also about acknowledging the emotions and experiences that are tied to them. By creating a digital archive, you're not only preserving the tangible memories, but also the emotional significance that they hold for you. How do you think this process of digital archiving might help you come to terms with the changing live music scene, and what do you hope to gain from this experience?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think that the process of digital archiving my memories would help me come to terms with the changing live music scene by allowing me to preserve the emotions and experiences that are tied to those memories. It's like, even if I can't hold onto the tangible memories, I can still hold onto the emotions and experiences that those memories evoke. And I think that would be really powerful for me, to have a way to reflect on those memories and emotions whenever I need to. By doing so, I hope to gain a sense of closure and acceptance, and to be able to move forward with a newfound appreciation for the memories and experiences I've had, rather than dwelling on what's been lost.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>I can understand why the idea of curating a digital archive of your memories resonates with you, given the emotional significance of those experiences. It's as if you're not just preserving the memories themselves, but also the emotions and connections that made them meaningful. Can you tell me more about what you hope to gain from this process, and how you envision it helping you come to terms with the changing live music scene?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think that the process of digital archiving my memories would be a way for me to process my emotions and come to terms with the changing live music scene.

                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>As you continue to navigate this significant change in the live music scene, it's striking how much emotional significance is tied to your memories of attending concerts and festivals. By creating a digital archive, you're not only preserving the memories themselves but also acknowledging the emotional experiences that made them special.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think I'm starting to understand why I'm so attached to the idea of preserving these memories. It's not just about holding onto the past, but also about acknowledging the emotions and experiences that made those memories meaningful. By creating a digital archive, I'm not only preserving the memories themselves but also the emotional significance that they hold for me.

                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>As you explore this idea of creating a digital archive of your memories, I want to acknowledge that it's not just about preserving the memories themselves, but also about acknowledging the emotional significance that they hold for you. It's almost as if you're creating a time capsule of sorts, where you're capturing not just the what, but also the why and how of those experiences.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think that's a great idea. I can see how creating a digital archive of my memories would help me process my emotions and come to terms with the changing live music scene. It's like, even if I can't hold onto the tangible memories, I can still hold onto the emotions and experiences that those memories evoke. And I think that would be really powerful for me, to have a way to reflect on those memories and emotions whenever I need to.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're considering the digital archive as a way to not only preserve the memories but also to acknowledge the emotional significance they hold for you. What do you think would be the most challenging part of creating this archive, and how do you envision it helping you process your emotions and come to terms with the changing live music scene?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think the most challenging part of creating this archive would be deciding what memories to include and how to organize them in a way that makes sense to me. I also worry that it might feel overwhelming to relive so many memories, especially the ones that are more difficult or painful.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're already thinking deeply about how to approach this process, and I appreciate your willingness to explore the emotional significance of your memories. As you consider the most meaningful way to organize your memories in the digital archive, I'm curious - what do you think would be the most compelling way to categorize them, and how do you envision this process helping you process your emotions and come to terms with the changing live music scene?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think the idea of categorizing my memories by theme or emotion is really appealing to me. For example, I could have a section for memories that are related to specific bands or festivals, and then another section for memories that are more emotional or personal, like the memories I've made with friends and family at concerts. I think this would help me see the patterns and connections between my memories, and it would also give me a way to reflect on how my emotions and experiences have evolved over time.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>As you explore the idea of creating a digital archive of your memories, I'm struck by how it's not just about preserving the memories themselves, but also about acknowledging the emotional significance that they hold for you. By categorizing your memories by theme or emotion, you're essentially creating a map of your emotional landscape over time. What do you think would be the most empowering aspect of having this map, and how do you envision it helping you navigate the changing live music scene in a way that feels authentic and meaningful to you?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think it would be really empowering to have a map of my emotional landscape over time, because it would give me a sense of control and understanding over my emotions and experiences.

By having a digital archive of my memories, I feel like I would be able to hold onto the emotions and experiences that are tied to those memories, even if the physical memories themselves are lost.
