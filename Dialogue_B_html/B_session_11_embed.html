                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Hi Maven, I'm glad you are here today. How are you feeling as we start this session?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I'm feeling a bit nervous, honestly. Not really sure what to expect.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It's understandable that you might feel a bit uncertain about opening up to a stranger, especially when sharing personal concerns. Can you help me understand what specifically is causing you to feel this way, and how you've been coping with these emotions so far?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I guess I've just always felt like I'm not good enough, especially compared to my sister. She's always been talented at music and I've always felt like I'm not measuring up. It's like, I can't even play an instrument and she's out there rocking it. It's hard not to feel like I'm somehow less of a person because of it.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It's not uncommon for people to feel like they're living up to others' expectations, rather than their own, which can lead to feelings of inadequacy. Can you help me understand what you think your sister would say if she knew how much her talent in music was affecting you?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>That's a good question. I think she would be surprised, actually. She's always been really supportive of me, and I don't think she realizes the impact her music has on me. But at the same time, I don't think she would understand why I'm so affected by it. She's always been the one who's been good at something, and I've always been the one who's struggled. It's like, I feel like I'm always playing catch-up, and no matter how hard I try, I'll never be good enough.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like carrying this burden of comparison and self-doubt has been a persistent theme in your life, and it's understandable that you're struggling to find a sense of peace and confidence. Can you tell me more about what you think would happen if you were to let go of this constant need to compare yourself to your sister, and instead focus on your own strengths and passions? How do you think that would impact your relationships and overall well-being?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I don't know, that sounds easier said than done. I feel like letting go of the comparison would mean I'm accepting that I'm not as talented as my sister, and that's hard to swallow. But at the same time, I'm tired of feeling like I'm stuck in this rut, constantly worrying about what others think of me. I guess I just don't know how to shift my focus away from what I'm not good at and onto what I am good at.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're carrying a heavy burden of expectation, not just from your sister, but also from yourself, and that's exhausting. Can you help me understand what you think would happen if you were to let go of this need to be perfect and focus on being the best English Literature tutor you can be, rather than trying to measure up to someone else's standard?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think that would be incredibly freeing, actually. As an English Literature tutor, I know I'm good at what I do, and I love sharing my passion with my students. But when I'm constantly comparing myself to my sister, it's like I'm forgetting all the things I'm capable of and focusing solely on what I'm not. If I could let go of that, I think I would feel more confident in my abilities and more at peace with myself.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>As you explore reframing your sense of identity and self-worth, I'm curious, what would it mean for you to prioritize your own strengths and passions as a tutor, rather than constantly measuring yourself against your sister's achievements? How do you think that shift might impact your relationships and overall sense of fulfillment?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think it would mean that I'm no longer trying to prove myself to anyone else, but rather, I'm focusing on what I can bring to the table as an English Literature tutor. I would be more confident in my abilities and more passionate about sharing my knowledge with my students. It would also mean that I'm not constantly comparing myself to my sister, which would be a huge weight off my shoulders.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>As you start to imagine yourself as a tutor who prioritizes your own strengths and passions, I'm intrigued by the idea that you might discover a sense of fulfillment and purpose that's not tied to comparing yourself to your sister. Can you tell me more about what you think you might gain from focusing on your own unique talents and abilities, and how that might translate into your daily life as a tutor?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think one thing that would be really helpful is if I could learn to appreciate my own strengths and accomplishments, rather than constantly comparing myself to my sister. As an English Literature tutor, I know I'm good at my job, but I find myself downplaying my achievements because I feel like they're not as impressive as my sister's music skills. If I could learn to celebrate my own successes and recognize my own value, I think that would help me feel more confident and fulfilled in my daily life.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>As you've been carrying this weight of comparison and self-doubt for a while now, it's understandable that you're struggling to find a sense of peace and confidence. I'd like to build on our conversation by exploring how this concept of a growth mindset might apply to your own experiences and relationships. By reframing your sense of identity and self-worth, you might find that you're able to separate your self-worth from your sister's achievements and instead focus on your own strengths and passions as an English Literature tutor. What do you think would be the most important step for you to take in order to start embracing a growth mindset and prioritizing your own unique talents and abilities?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think one step I could take is to start acknowledging and celebrating my own accomplishments as an English Literature tutor, rather than constantly comparing myself to my sister's music skills. Maybe I could keep a journal or a 'success log' where I write down all the things I'm proud of, no matter how small they may seem. That way, I can start to shift my focus away from what I'm not good at and onto what I am good at.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>By acknowledging and celebrating your own accomplishments, you're not only building confidence in your abilities as an English Literature tutor, but also cultivating a sense of self-worth that isn't tied to your sister's successes. This can be a powerful way to break free from the constant comparison and focus on your own unique strengths and passions.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think it's funny, because when I first started thinking about this, I felt like I would be giving up or admitting defeat if I stopped comparing myself to my sister. But the more I think about it, the more I realize that it's not about being better or worse than her, it's about being the best version of myself. If I can focus on my own strengths and passions, I think I'll feel more fulfilled and confident in my daily life, regardless of whether my sister is good at music or not.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>As you've started to see the value in focusing on your own strengths and passions, I'm curious, how do you think this shift in perspective could impact your relationships with your students and colleagues? Could you imagine a scenario where you're not only teaching English Literature, but also inspiring and mentoring others through your unique approach and expertise?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think that's a really beautiful vision. I can see myself being more confident and passionate about my teaching, and that would definitely impact my relationships with my students and colleagues. They would see me as a expert in my field, not just someone who's trying to keep up with their sister's talents.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>As you've been reflecting on your sense of identity and self-worth, I'm curious to know more about what specific strengths and passions you've discovered within yourself as an English Literature tutor. How do you think these newfound insights could inform your approach to teaching and interacting with your students, and what kind of impact do you imagine this could have on their learning and growth?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think I'm starting to realize that my self-worth isn't defined by my sister's talents or my own perceived lack thereof. I'm starting to see that I have my own unique strengths and passions as an English Literature tutor, and that's something to be proud of. I'm excited to explore this idea further and see how it can impact my relationships with my students and colleagues.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>As you continue to cultivate this sense of self-worth and confidence, I'm curious about how you envision using your unique strengths and passions as an English Literature tutor to create a more empowering and inclusive learning environment for your students from diverse backgrounds and learning styles. How do you think your approach could adapt to meet the individual needs of your students, and what strategies do you think would be most effective in fostering a sense of belonging and community in your classroom?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>That's a really good question. I think one thing that would be helpful is if I could learn to appreciate my own strengths and accomplishments, rather than constantly comparing myself to my sister. As an English Literature tutor, I know I'm good at my job, but I find myself downplaying my achievements because I feel like they're not as impressive as my sister's music skills. If I could learn to celebrate my own successes and recognize my own value, I think that would help me feel more confident and fulfilled in my daily life.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It's interesting that you mention wanting to incorporate more of your personal interests and experiences into your teaching approach. Can you tell me more about what you think would happen if you were to take this leap and start sharing more of yourself with your students? How do you think this might help them connect with the material on a deeper level and what kind of impact do you imagine this could have on their learning and growth?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I appreciate your insight into reframing my sense of identity and self-worth. It's taken me a while to realize that I don't have to define myself based on my sister's talents or my own perceived lack thereof. I think one step I could take is to start acknowledging and celebrating my own accomplishments as an English Literature tutor, rather than constantly comparing myself to my sister's music skills. Maybe I could keep a journal or a 'success log' where I write down all the things I'm proud of, no matter how small they may seem. That way, I can start to shift my focus away from what I'm not good at and onto what I am good at.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It seems like you've been carrying a significant amount of emotional weight by constantly comparing yourself to your sister, and that's not only affecting your relationships but also your sense of self-worth.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think I'm starting to realize that I've been living in a state of constant comparison and that's been holding me back from embracing my own strengths and passions as an English Literature tutor. I've been so focused on trying to measure up to my sister's achievements that I've forgotten what I'm good at and what I'm passionate about. I'm excited to start exploring this idea further and see how it can impact my relationships with my students and colleagues.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>As you start to shift your focus away from comparing yourself to your sister and towards your own strengths and passions as an English Literature tutor, you may find that you're more able to connect with your students on a deeper level. By sharing your own experiences and interests with them, you can help them see that learning isn't just about getting good grades, but about exploring and discovering who they are as individuals.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think I'm starting to see that my self-worth isn't defined by my sister's talents or my own perceived lack thereof.

                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>As you've shared your thoughts on embracing your strengths and passions as an English Literature tutor, I'm struck by the potential ripple effect this could have on your students. By being more authentic and vulnerable, you're not only inspiring your students to explore their own interests, but also creating a safe space for them to do so. Can you tell me more about what specific aspects of your teaching style or approach you think might benefit from this shift towards authenticity?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think that's a really great question. I've been so focused on trying to be perfect and measure up to my sister's achievements that I've forgotten what I'm good at and what I'm passionate about. As an English Literature tutor, I know I'm good at my job, but I find myself downplaying my achievements because I feel like they're not as impressive as my sister's music skills.

                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>As you continue to explore this idea of embracing your own strengths and passions as an English Literature tutor, I'd like to gently challenge you to reframe your understanding of what it means to be a successful tutor. Rather than comparing yourself to your sister or others, what would it mean to focus on the positive impact you're already having on your students' lives? How might that shift in perspective allow you to cultivate a sense of purpose and fulfillment that's not tied to external validation?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think I've been carrying a heavy burden of expectation, not just from my sister, but also from myself, and that's exhausting. It's like I'm constantly trying to prove myself to others, rather than just being myself. I'm tired of feeling like I'm stuck in this rut, constantly worrying about what others think of me. I guess I just don't know how to shift my focus away from what I'm not good at and onto what I am good at.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It's remarkable how much emotional energy you've been investing in this constant comparison with your sister, and it's no wonder it's taking a toll on your self-worth. Research suggests that when we focus on our own strengths and passions, we're more likely to experience a sense of purpose and fulfillment. As you explore new ways to cultivate your sense of identity as an English Literature tutor, I'd like to introduce you to the concept of self-compassion. Would you be open to learning more about what self-compassion is and how it might help you develop a more authentic and confident approach to your tutoring?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I'm really surprised by how much relief I feel now that I've started to recognize that my self-worth isn't defined by my sister's talents or my own perceived lack thereof. It's like a weight has been lifted off my shoulders. I think I've been carrying around this burden of expectation for so long, and it's exhausting. I'm excited to start exploring this idea of self-compassion and learning how to cultivate a more authentic and confident approach to my tutoring.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It's amazing to see how you're recognizing the connection between your sense of identity and self-worth, and your approach to tutoring. By embracing your unique strengths and passions, you're not only building confidence, but also creating a more authentic and empowering learning environment for your students. Can you tell me more about what specific steps you think you'll take to start focusing on your own strengths and passions as an English Literature tutor, and how you envision using your expertise to create a more inclusive and empowering space for your students?</div>

                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>As you explore this concept of self-compassion and authenticity, I want to highlight that it's not uncommon for individuals to struggle with comparing themselves to others, especially family members. It's a common pattern, and one that can be challenging to break. By acknowledging this tendency and actively working to cultivate self-compassion, you're taking a significant step towards building a more authentic and empowering approach to tutoring.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think one step I could take is to start acknowledging and celebrating my own accomplishments as an English Literature tutor, rather than constantly comparing myself to my sister's music skills.
