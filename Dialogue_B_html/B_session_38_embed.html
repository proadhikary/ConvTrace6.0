                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Hi Julia, welcome. I’m glad you’re here today. How are you feeling right now?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I’ve been replaying the moments before my cat passed away over and over in my head, and I just can’t shake the feeling that I could have done more to prevent it.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It's understandable that you're still grappling with the what-ifs and replaying those moments in your head. This kind of self-blame can be especially tricky to shake off, especially when we're already in a place of grief and loss. Can you tell me more about what you mean by I could have done more to prevent it? What specific thoughts or memories keep coming up for you in those moments of replay?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I keep thinking about the arguments I had with my cat, and how I should have been more patient with it. I also keep replaying the moments when I was away from home and couldn't check on it, wondering if that was the moment it got sick or injured. It's like my mind is stuck on the idea that if I had just done things differently, it would still be alive.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It's not uncommon for people to carry around a mix of emotions, including guilt, regret, and what-ifs, especially when it comes to a significant loss like the passing of a beloved pet. It sounds like these feelings are still quite raw for you, and it's like your mind is trying to replay those moments to somehow change the outcome. Can we explore together how we might gently challenge some of these critical thoughts and work towards a more compassionate understanding of yourself and your relationship with your cat?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>It's hard for me to let go of these thoughts because I feel like they're a reminder of my failures as a pet owner. I know it's not rational, but it's like my cat's death is a constant reminder of my inadequacy.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're carrying around a lot of weight from the loss of your cat, and it's affecting your sense of self-worth as a pet owner. Can we explore what you think your cat would want you to learn from this experience, and how you can honor their memory while also taking care of yourself during this difficult time?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>It's hard to think about what my cat would want me to learn from this experience, because I'm still stuck on the idea that I could have done more to prevent its death. But maybe... maybe my cat would want me to learn to be kinder to myself, to recognize that I did the best I could as a pet owner, and that their death was not my fault. It's hard to believe that, though.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It's understandable that you're still grappling with the idea that your cat's death wasn't a reflection of your worth or abilities. This phenomenon is quite common, actually - we often take on more responsibility than we need to, and it's hard to break free from that pattern of thinking. Can you tell me more about what you think is holding you back from letting go of this guilt and accepting that you did the best you could as a pet owner?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>It's like I'm stuck in this cycle of self-blame and guilt, and I don't know how to break free from it. I feel like I'm constantly replaying the moments before my cat's death, wondering what I could have done differently. And even though I know it's not logical, I still feel like I let my cat down. I'm not sure what I need to do to move forward and accept that I did the best I could.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're already aware that your thoughts are stuck in a pattern of self-blame and guilt, and it's taking a toll on your mental health. Your cat's passing has brought up feelings of regret and what-ifs, and it's understandable that you'd want to change the outcome. Can we explore this idea of what you would have done differently if you could go back in time, and what that might look like in terms of your relationship with your cat?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think I understand what you're getting at with the idea of replaying the moments before my cat's death, but it's hard for me to imagine doing anything differently. It's like my mind is stuck on the idea that I could have taken better care of my cat, and that's what led to its death. But maybe... maybe my cat would want me to learn to be kinder to myself, to recognize that I did the best I could as a pet owner, and that their death was not my fault. It's hard to believe that, though.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're still grappling with the idea that you could have done something to prevent your cat's passing, and that's making it hard for you to move forward. It's understandable that you're drawn to replaying those moments, trying to make sense of what happened. This kind of rumination can be a natural response to loss, and it's not uncommon for people to get stuck in this pattern. Can we explore some strategies to help you break free from this cycle and start honoring your cat's memory in a way that feels more meaningful and less focused on guilt and regret?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I've been replaying the moments before my cat's death so many times, it feels like I'm stuck in a never-ending loop. I keep thinking about how I could have prevented it if only I had done things differently. But the more I replay those moments, the more I realize that I'm not really changing anything. It's like I'm just stuck in this cycle of self-blame and guilt, and I don't know how to break free from it.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It's interesting that you mention feeling stuck in a time warp, replaying those moments over and over. I wonder if you've noticed any patterns or triggers that might be contributing to these loops, such as certain emotions, environments, or situations that seem to set off the replaying. Additionally, I'd like to offer that reappraisal strategy I mentioned earlier as a way to start reframing those memories and moving forward. Would you be willing to give it a try and see if it helps shift your perspective?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think I understand what you're getting at with the reappraisal strategy, but it's hard for me to imagine reframing those memories in a positive light. I feel like my cat's death was a direct result of my negligence, and that's a difficult thing to accept. I'm not sure if I'm ready to let go of that guilt and move forward.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It's understandable that you're struggling to accept that your cat's death was not a direct result of your actions, and that's making it hard for you to move forward. Research has shown that pet owners often experience survivor's guilt after the loss of a pet, where they feel responsible for the pet's death, even if it was due to circumstances beyond their control. Can we explore this idea further and see if it might help you begin to shift your perspective on this experience and find a way to release some of the guilt and self-blame you're carrying?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think I understand what you're getting at with the idea of reframing those memories, but it's hard for me to imagine accepting that my cat's death was not a direct result of my actions. I feel like I've been carrying this guilt around for so long, it's hard to imagine letting go of it. But maybe... maybe if I could find a way to honor my cat's memory without beating myself up over it, that would be a start.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're really grappling with the idea of moving forward and honoring your cat's memory in a way that feels authentic and meaningful to you, rather than getting stuck in feelings of guilt and regret. Can you tell me more about what you think would be a way to honor your cat's memory that would feel more compassionate and less focused on self-blame?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>It's interesting that you mention the idea of reframing memories to honor my cat's memory without beating myself up over it. I think that's something I could try. Maybe I could start by writing down some positive memories of my time with my cat, like the way it would curl up in my lap or the way it would purr when I petted it. Just thinking about those moments makes me feel a little bit better. But I'm still having trouble letting go of the guilt and self-blame. I guess I feel like I need to find a way to forgive myself before I can move on.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>As you've shared, forgiving yourself can be a complex and challenging process. It's not uncommon for people to struggle with feelings of responsibility and regret after a significant loss like the passing of a beloved pet. It takes a lot of courage to acknowledge and confront these emotions, and I want to acknowledge that effort. Can we explore what you think would be a first step in working towards forgiveness and releasing those negative emotions?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think I'm starting to understand that my guilt and self-blame might be holding me back from moving forward and honoring my cat's memory in a way that feels authentic to me. It's like I'm stuck in this cycle of replaying the moments before my cat's death, wondering what I could have done differently, and beating myself up over it. But maybe... maybe if I could find a way to reframe those memories and focus on the positive experiences I had with my cat, that would be a start. I'm not sure if I'm ready to forgive myself just yet, but I'm willing to try to work towards that. Can we explore some strategies to help me do that?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like acknowledging your guilt and self-blame is a significant step towards moving forward and honoring your cat's memory in a way that feels authentic to you. I'd like to build on that awareness by exploring how self-compassion can play a role in your healing process. Self-compassion is not about erasing the past or dismissing your emotions, but rather about treating yourself with kindness, understanding, and acceptance, just as you would a close friend.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think I'm starting to understand that my guilt and self-blame might be holding me back from moving forward and honoring my cat's memory in a way that feels authentic to me.

                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It's interesting to me that you're recognizing the ways in which your guilt and self-blame have been holding you back, and that's a really important step towards processing your emotions and moving forward. It's also common to feel that sense of responsibility and regret after a significant loss like the passing of a beloved pet, and it's not necessarily a straightforward process to work through those feelings. Can we explore how you might use self-compassion to help you navigate this healing process and find a way to honor your cat's memory that feels authentic and meaningful to you?</div>

                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>As we explore these ideas together, I want to acknowledge that it can be really tough to let go of the guilt and self-blame, especially when we feel like we're responsible for something. But I also want to remind you that self-blame is often a natural response to a significant loss, and it doesn't mean you're a bad person or that you didn't do enough. It's almost like our minds are trying to make sense of something that's senseless, and that can be really painful. Let's keep exploring what it might look like to find a way to honor your cat's memory that feels authentic and meaningful to you, without getting stuck in those feelings of guilt and self-blame.</div>

                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It seems like acknowledging the guilt and self-blame is a crucial step in moving forward and honoring your cat's memory. By recognizing how those emotions have been holding you back, you're opening up the possibility for a more compassionate and meaningful way to remember your cat. Can you tell me more about what you think would happen if you were able to release some of that guilt and self-blame, and what you imagine that would allow you to create or discover?</div>

                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>As you start to let go of that guilt and self-blame, it's essential to acknowledge that it's a common and understandable reaction to the loss of a beloved pet. It's a natural part of the grieving process, and it doesn't mean you didn't love or care for your cat enough. In fact, the weight of that guilt and self-blame can actually hold you back from fully experiencing the emotions and memories you have of your cat. By releasing some of that weight, you may find that you're better able to focus on the positive experiences and memories you shared with your cat, and that can help you find a more authentic and meaningful way to honor their memory.</div>
