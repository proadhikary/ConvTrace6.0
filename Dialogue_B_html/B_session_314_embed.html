                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Hello, Gerald. Thank you for joining our session today. How are you feeling about being here?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Well, like I mentioned, I'm not really sure if this will help. I just don't get why the endings of books bother me so much. It feels like I'm setting myself up for disappointment every time I start a new one.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're really trying to understand why you're experiencing this frustration with book endings, and it's understandable that you're feeling skeptical about whether seeking help will make a difference. Can you tell me more about what you think might happen if you could find a way to shift your perspective on how stories conclude?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I don't know... I just feel like no matter how hard I try, I'll never be able to change the way I react to those endings. It's like it's just a part of who I am, and I'll never be able to break free from it.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're carrying a heavy burden of self-doubt and frustration about this, and it's making it hard for you to see a way out of this cycle. Can you help me understand what you think would happen if you were able to let go of the need for control over how you react to book endings? Would you feel a sense of relief, or maybe even excitement to discover new possibilities?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>It's hard for me to imagine a scenario where I wouldn't feel like I'm setting myself up for disappointment. I've been doing this for so long, I don't know how to be any other way.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It's fascinating to see how this pattern has developed over time, and how it's become such a deeply ingrained part of your reading experience. Can you help me understand what you think would happen if you were to start exploring different genres or formats that often have more definitive conclusions, such as mystery novels or comic books? Might that be a way for you to challenge this pattern and discover new ways of engaging with stories?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>It sounds like you're suggesting I should just try to distract myself from the problem by reading different types of books. But I don't think that's going to solve anything. I've tried that before, and I just end up feeling like I'm avoiding the issue rather than actually addressing it.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It seems like you're really grappling with the idea that exploring new genres or formats might be a way to break free from this pattern, and that's a really important consideration. Can you help me understand what you mean by addressing the issue - are you looking for a permanent solution, or something that just helps you feel more comfortable in the moment while you're reading?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I don't know, it seems like no matter how hard I try, I'll never be able to change the way I react to those endings. It's like it's just a part of who I am, and I'll never be able to break free from it.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It's as if you're carrying this weight of self-doubt and frustration around with you, and it's making it hard to imagine a different way of being. Can you help me understand what you think would happen if you were to let go of the need for control over how you react to book endings? Would you feel a sense of relief, or maybe even excitement to discover new possibilities?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I guess what bothers me the most is that I feel like I'm stuck in this pattern, and I don't know how to get out of it. It's like I'm trapped in this cycle of disappointment and frustration, and I don't know how to break free.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're really feeling the weight of this pattern, and it's affecting your ability to fully engage with reading, which is an activity that's supposed to bring you joy. Can you help me understand what you think would happen if you were to start small and experiment with different genres or formats that have more definitive conclusions, like mystery novels or comic books? Maybe that would help you feel a sense of control and agency over your reading experience, and potentially break you out of this cycle of disappointment and frustration?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I feel like I'm stuck in this pattern, and I don't know how to get out of it. It's like I'm trapped in this cycle of disappointment and frustration, and I don't know how to break free.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It's interesting that you bring up the idea of feeling trapped, and I wonder if there's a way to reframe that sense of trapness as a natural part of the process of exploring and learning about yourself. Maybe instead of trying to break free from it, you could see this pattern as an opportunity to develop a greater understanding of your own thoughts and emotions. What do you think about that?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I don't know, it seems like every time I try to think about changing my reaction to book endings, I just get stuck in this cycle of self-doubt and frustration. It's like I'm so used to feeling disappointed that I don't even know how to imagine a different way of being.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're really caught up in this cycle of self-doubt and frustration, and it's making it hard for you to see a way out. I want to acknowledge that it's normal to feel this way when we're stuck in a pattern and don't know how to break free. In fact, research suggests that our brains are wired to focus on negative experiences and emotions because it helps us learn and adapt. So, it's possible that your brain is simply doing what comes naturally to it when you're trying to make sense of your feelings about book endings. Can you help me understand what you think would happen if you were to start viewing this pattern as a natural part of your learning and growth, rather than something to be overcome?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>It's hard for me to imagine a different way of being when I've been stuck in this pattern for so long. I feel like I've tried everything, and nothing seems to work. I'm not even sure why I'm still trying, because it feels like I'm just going to end up feeling disappointed again.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're carrying a heavy emotional weight from the disappointment and frustration you've experienced in the past, and it's making it difficult for you to imagine a different future for yourself. Can you help me understand what you think would happen if you were to start to reframe your relationship with book endings, rather than seeing them as a source of disappointment, but instead as an opportunity to explore your emotions and thoughts in a more intentional way?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>It's like... I'm so tired of feeling stuck in this pattern. I'm tired of feeling like I'm just going to end up disappointed no matter what I do. I feel like I've tried everything, and nothing seems to work. I'm not even sure why I'm still trying, because it feels like I'm just going to end up feeling disappointed again.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're feeling a sense of exhaustion and hopelessness about this pattern, and it's affecting your ability to even imagine trying to change it. I want to acknowledge that it's okay to feel that way, and that it's normal to feel like you're stuck in a cycle that's hard to break. In fact, research has shown that when we're stuck in patterns that feel insurmountable, it can be really tough to muster up the energy to try and change them. But I want to gently suggest that maybe, just maybe, we can start to reframe our thinking around this pattern. Instead of seeing it as something that's happening to you, what if we start to see it as an opportunity to learn more about yourself and your thoughts and emotions?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I don't know, it's like I'm just stuck in this cycle of disappointment and frustration, and I don't know how to break free from it. It feels like I've tried everything, and nothing seems to work.

                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're carrying a heavy emotional burden from feeling stuck in this pattern, and it's making it difficult for you to imagine a different future for yourself. I'd like to offer that sometimes, when we're feeling stuck, it can be helpful to break the pattern down into smaller, more manageable pieces. Instead of looking at the overall pattern of disappointment and frustration, what if we start to explore what's happening in just one specific moment, like when you're finishing a book and feeling disappointed? What do you think would happen if you were to start to pay attention to your physical sensations, your emotions, and your thoughts in that moment, rather than trying to change the pattern altogether?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I don't know, it feels like every time I try to think about changing my reaction to book endings, I just get stuck in this cycle of self-doubt and frustration.

                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>As you've shared, it's as if you're taken aback by the realization that this pattern has become so deeply ingrained, and it's hard to imagine a time when you didn't feel this way about book endings. It's almost as if this pattern has become a part of your identity, and the thought of changing it feels like it would require a fundamental shift in who you are as a reader.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I understand what you're saying, but it's hard for me to see how breaking this pattern down into smaller pieces would make a difference. It feels like I've tried every approach, and nothing has worked. I'm starting to feel like I'm never going to be able to change the way I react to book endings.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>As you explore the different emotions and thoughts that arise when you're finishing a book and feeling disappointed, I want to gently remind you that it's a common experience for readers to feel this way. In fact, research suggests that our brains are wired to focus on negative experiences and emotions because it helps us learn and adapt. So, it's possible that your brain is simply doing what comes naturally to it when you're trying to make sense of your feelings about book endings. Would you be willing to explore this idea further and see if it might help shift your perspective on this pattern?</div>

I'd like to offer that maybe, just maybe, this pattern isn't as fixed as it feels right now. Research suggests that our brains are constantly rewiring and adapting, and it's possible that with intentional practice and self-awareness, you might be able to rewire your brain to respond differently to book endings. Would you be willing to explore some strategies together that might help you start to rewire your brain in this way?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I'm starting to feel like I'm stuck in a rut, and no matter how hard I try, I just can't seem to break free from this pattern of disappointment and frustration.
