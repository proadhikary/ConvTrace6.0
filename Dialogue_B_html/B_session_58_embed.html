                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Hi Jonathan, it's nice to meet you. How are you feeling about being here today?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I'm feeling a bit anxious, but I’m also hopeful. I’ve been dealing with these feelings of self-doubt and stagnation in my career and I want to find a way to change that.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It's interesting that you mention your father's successful career at Microsoft. Can you tell me more about how you think his expectations or your own comparisons to him might be influencing your feelings of self-doubt and stagnation? How do you think those dynamics might be playing out for you?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>That's a great question, counselor. I think my father's success and my own perceived lack of skills in programming have definitely contributed to my feelings of inadequacy. I often find myself comparing my skills to those of my colleagues, feeling like I'm falling short. It's like I'm constantly trying to live up to this unattainable standard.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It's interesting that you mention feeling like you're constantly striving to meet unattainable standards, and I think that's a really important insight. The Fool's Errand concept can be really powerful in understanding why we might be feeling this way. Can you help me understand what you think would happen if you were able to acknowledge that these expectations are not necessarily realistic, and that you're capable of setting your own goals and measuring your own success? How might that shift your experience in the workplace and your sense of self-worth?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>That makes a lot of sense, counselor. I never thought about it that way. If I were to acknowledge that these expectations are not realistic and that I'm capable of setting my own goals and measuring my own success, I think it would be a huge relief. I would no longer feel like I'm constantly trying to prove myself to others, and I would be able to focus on my own strengths and abilities. It would also help me to stop comparing myself to others and to focus on my own progress and growth.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're already starting to see the potential benefits of acknowledging and challenging these unrealistic expectations, which is really promising. When we recognize the unrealistic nature of these expectations and take control of setting our own goals and measuring our own success, it can be a powerful way to shift our experience in the workplace and sense of self-worth. How can you start to integrate this new understanding into your daily work routine, and what small steps can you take to start building your internal locus of control?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>That's a great question, counselor. I think a good starting point would be to focus on my strengths and the skills I've already developed, rather than dwelling on my perceived weaknesses. Maybe I can set some achievable goals for myself, such as completing a certain project or learning a new skill, and celebrate my successes along the way. I also think it would be helpful to have a conversation with my colleagues about how we can support each other and focus on our individual strengths, rather than constantly comparing ourselves to one another.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It seems like you're grappling with the tension between pursuing your own goals and meeting others' expectations. Can you help me understand how this dynamic has played out in your work in the past? Have there been any instances where you've felt like you've compromised your own values or aspirations to fit in with what others wanted from you?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>That's a great question, counselor. I think about a project I worked on a few months ago where I was tasked with implementing a new software system. My colleagues were all very experienced and had worked on similar projects before, so I felt like I was in over my head. I ended up compromising on some of my design choices to fit in with what the team wanted, and I felt really frustrated and resentful afterward. It was like I was sacrificing my own expertise and creativity to fit in with everyone else's expectations.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It's understandable that you felt like you had to sacrifice your own goals and values to fit in, and that can be a really tough spot to be in. Social identity theory suggests that we often prioritize belonging and acceptance over staying true to ourselves, and it sounds like you've experienced that firsthand. Can you help me explore how you think you can start to prioritize your own needs and aspirations alongside the expectations of your colleagues and team members, so that you're not constantly feeling like you're losing yourself in the process?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think that's a great point, counselor. I can see how prioritizing my own needs and aspirations alongside the expectations of my colleagues and team members could be a game-changer. I've been so focused on trying to fit in and meet others' expectations that I've neglected my own goals and values. By acknowledging and respecting my own strengths and abilities, I can start to build my internal locus of control and make decisions that align with my own goals and aspirations.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like this is a really important consideration for you, and it's not uncommon for people to struggle with prioritizing their own needs and aspirations in a work setting where there are many demands and expectations. The concept of self-determination theory can be really helpful in understanding why this is so important. When we're able to exert control over our own lives and make choices that align with our values, we experience a sense of fulfillment and motivation. Can you help me understand what specific steps you think you can take to start prioritizing your own needs and goals alongside the expectations of your colleagues and team members?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>That's a great point, counselor. I think one step I can take is to start setting clear boundaries with my colleagues and team members, communicating my own goals and priorities and asking for their support and feedback. I also want to make sure I'm taking time for myself to reflect on my own strengths and abilities, and to prioritize my own well-being and happiness.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Can you help me understand how you envision yourself handling situations where others might push back or resist your new boundaries and priorities, and what kind of support system or resources do you think you'll need to maintain your sense of self and autonomy in the face of potential pushback?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>That's a great point, counselor. I think I can start by being more assertive and communicating my boundaries clearly, but I also understand that it might be challenging to do so. I'll need to be prepared to respond to potential pushback or resistance from my colleagues, and having a support system in place, such as talking to a trusted friend or mentor, could be really helpful.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>As I hear you talk about prioritizing your own needs and goals, I'm struck by the sense of agency and autonomy that comes with making decisions that align with your values and aspirations. Can you help me understand what you think would happen if you were to embody that sense of agency in your daily work routine, and how you would navigate potential resistance or pushback from others while still staying true to yourself?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think that's a great point, counselor. I can see how embodying that sense of agency and autonomy would be a game-changer for me. If I were to prioritize my own needs and goals alongside the expectations of my colleagues and team members, I would feel more confident and empowered in my work. I would be able to make decisions that align with my values and aspirations, and I would no longer feel like I'm constantly trying to prove myself to others. I would also be able to build stronger relationships with my colleagues, based on mutual respect and trust, rather than competition and comparison.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>As you continue to explore this vision of prioritizing your own needs and goals, I'm curious to know how you think you might need to navigate potential conflicts or challenges that might arise when you start making decisions that align with your values and aspirations. Can you help me understand what kind of communication strategies or boundary-setting skills you would use to maintain your sense of self and autonomy in the face of opposition or resistance from others?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>That's a great point, counselor. I think I would need to be prepared to communicate my priorities and boundaries clearly and assertively, while also being open to feedback and willing to find common ground with my colleagues. I would also need to prioritize self-care and make time for activities that bring me joy and fulfillment, such as spending time with friends or pursuing hobbies. Additionally, I would need to be mindful of my own emotions and reactions when faced with resistance or pushback, and take steps to manage my stress and anxiety in a healthy way.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It's fascinating to me that you're recognizing the interconnectedness of your personal and professional growth, and how it's influencing your desire for autonomy and authenticity in your work. Can you help me explore what specific steps you think you would need to take to prioritize your own needs and goals, and how you envision your colleagues and team members responding to these changes?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>That makes a lot of sense, counselor.

As we explore this further, I want to share with you that research has shown that setting clear boundaries and prioritizing self-care can actually lead to increased job satisfaction and improved work-life balance. Can you help me understand what specific steps you think you would need to take to maintain your sense of self and autonomy in the face of potential pushback or resistance from others, and what kind of support system or resources you think you'll need to make this shift?</div>

                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>As you consider making changes to prioritize your own needs and goals, it's also essential to recognize that this shift is a common and necessary part of personal and professional growth. Research has shown that individuals who prioritize their own well-being and autonomy tend to experience increased job satisfaction, reduced burnout, and improved relationships with colleagues.
