                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Hi Brianna, it's nice to meet you. How are you feeling today?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I'm feeling a bit nervous about this session.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're feeling a bit anxious about our session, and that's completely normal. Many people feel a sense of uncertainty when starting therapy, especially if it's their first time. Can you help me understand what specifically is making you nervous about opening up to me? Is it the idea of discussing certain topics or sharing personal feelings that's causing you distress?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Honestly, I'm not really sure what's making me nervous. I guess I'm just worried that you'll think I'm weird or that my thoughts are too silly to talk about.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It's not uncommon for people to feel this way, and it's great that you're acknowledging these concerns. Can you tell me more about what specifically is making you worry about being judged or perceived as weird? Is there something in particular that's led you to feel this way about sharing your thoughts and feelings with me?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah, I guess it's just that I feel like I'm always worrying about what others think of me, even online when I'm playing games with friends. I'll be like, Oh, they're laughing at me or They think I'm not good enough. It's like my mind always goes to the worst-case scenario, and it's hard to shake that feeling off.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It's interesting that you mention League of Legends, and how the pressure to perform and the fear of being judged by others can be overwhelming. It sounds like you're not only struggling with the game itself, but also with the emotional toll that comes with it. Can you tell me more about what you think would happen if you were able to let go of those worries and just focus on playing the game for the sake of enjoying it, rather than trying to prove yourself to others?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah, I think if I could just let go of the need for validation from others, I might be able to relax and have more fun playing the game. But it's hard for me to imagine a scenario where I wouldn't care about what others think of me. It feels like it's just a big part of who I am.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It's interesting that you mention this need for validation is deeply ingrained in your identity, and it's hard to envision a version of yourself that doesn't care about what others think. I'm curious, what do you think would happen if you were to explore this need for validation further? What would you learn about yourself and why do you think it's become such a crucial part of your sense of self?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think that exploring this need for validation would help me understand why I feel the need to prove myself to others all the time. Maybe it's because I've always been afraid of being rejected or not good enough. I don't know, it's hard to say. But I do know that it's holding me back from enjoying things like playing League of Legends, and I want to be able to let go of that and just have fun.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It's not uncommon for people to feel like they're walking on eggshells, constantly trying to gauge how others perceive them, which can lead to feelings of uncertainty and self-doubt. Can you help me understand what you think would happen if you were to take a step back and reframe your self-worth, focusing on your own values and strengths rather than seeking validation from others?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think that would be really tough for me, actually. It's hard for me to imagine not caring about what others think of me, because it's just become such a big part of my identity.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>I think it's really important to acknowledge that this pattern of seeking validation from others is not only common, but it's also a learned behavior that can be changed. By recognizing how deeply ingrained it is, we can start to work on reframing your thoughts and emotions around playing League of Legends. Can you tell me more about what you think would happen if you were to start playing for the sake of playing, rather than seeking validation from others? What would be the benefits and drawbacks of that approach, and how might you cope with any feelings of uncertainty or discomfort that might arise?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah, I think if I could just let go of the need for validation from others, I might be able to relax and have more fun playing the game. But it's hard for me to imagine a scenario where I wouldn't care about what others think of me. It feels like it's just a big part of who I am.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It's really common for people to tie their sense of identity to external validation, and it sounds like that might be the case for you. Can you help me understand what you think you would gain from exploring this need for validation in a more intentional way, and how that might help you develop a more authentic sense of self that's not so closely tied to what others think?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah, I think if I could just let go of the need for validation from others, I might be able to relax and have more fun playing the game.

                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It seems like this desire for validation has become deeply tied to your sense of identity, and that's causing you a lot of distress. I want to acknowledge that it's not uncommon for people to struggle with this, especially during adolescence when social pressures can be intense. Research has shown that people often have a fundamental attribution error, which is the tendency to overestimate the role of personality and underestimate the impact of situational factors in shaping behavior. This might be applicable to your own behavior, and it could be affecting your ability to let go of the need for validation. Can you help me understand what you think would happen if you were to start small, by practicing self-compassion and acknowledging that it's okay to not be perfect or validated by others?</div>

                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're carrying a heavy burden of self-doubt and uncertainty, and it's affecting your ability to enjoy activities that were once a source of joy for you. Can you help me understand what you think would happen if you were to start to peel back the layers of this need for validation and explore what's beneath? Perhaps we can uncover some underlying values or desires that are driving this need, and work towards developing a more authentic sense of self that isn't so closely tied to external validation.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think that's what's been holding me back from enjoying League of Legends, the constant need to prove myself to others. It's like I'm always trying to live up to some expectation that's not even real. And it's exhausting.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It's interesting that you mention the pressure to be perfect and validated by others, as that's a common phenomenon that many people experience, especially in their teenage years. Can you help me understand what you think would happen if you were to start to separate your self-worth from your gaming performance, and focus on the aspects of the game that bring you joy, rather than trying to prove yourself to others?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think it's getting clearer to me that my need for validation is deeply rooted in my fear of rejection and failure. I've been carrying this burden of self-doubt for a while now, and it's affecting my relationships, my mood, and even my ability to enjoy activities that I love. I'm starting to see that this need for validation isn't just about being accepted by others, but also about proving to myself that I'm worthy of love and respect.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>As you've been exploring these underlying dynamics, I want to acknowledge that it can be really challenging to confront the possibility that your sense of self-worth has been tied to external validation. It's like you've been living in a system where you've been constantly seeking external confirmation to feel worthy, and now you're starting to realize that's not sustainable or healthy. Can you help me understand what you think would happen if you were to start to dismantle this system and create a new one that prioritizes self-compassion and self-acceptance?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think I'm starting to understand that my need for validation is not just about being accepted by others, but also about proving to myself that I'm worthy of love and respect.

                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>I can sense that acknowledging and exploring the root of your need for validation is a vulnerable and courageous process, and it's impressive that you're willing to confront these emotions. It's also important to recognize that creating a new system of self-worth based on self-compassion and self-acceptance is a process that requires time, patience, and understanding of the underlying dynamics driving your need for validation. Can you help me understand what you think it would mean to start to cultivate self-compassion and self-acceptance, and how you envision this process unfolding in your daily life?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think it's getting clearer to me that my need for validation is deeply rooted in my fear of rejection and failure.

And I think if I can start to dismantle this system and create a new one that prioritizes self-compassion and self-acceptance, I might be able to let go of this need for validation and just enjoy playing League of Legends without worrying about what others think of me.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It's remarkable how much insight you've gained into your need for validation and how it relates to your self-worth. The way you described it, it sounds like you're starting to grasp that this need is not just about external validation, but also about internal validation. As we explore this further, I'd like to share some information that might be helpful. Research has shown that people who prioritize self-compassion and self-acceptance tend to experience greater well-being and life satisfaction. Would you be open to exploring some strategies for cultivating more self-compassion and self-acceptance in your daily life, and how you think that might impact your relationships and overall sense of well-being?</div>

                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>As you explore these underlying dynamics, it's clear that you're taking a crucial step towards developing a more authentic sense of self-worth. I'd like to build on this insight by sharing some research on how our brains are wired to respond to social validation. Did you know that when we receive positive feedback, our brain releases dopamine, a neurotransmitter associated with pleasure and reward? Conversely, when we receive criticism or rejection, our brain releases cortisol, a hormone linked to stress and anxiety. This natural response helps us adapt to our environment, but it can also lead us to overemphasize external validation. Would you like to explore how this might be influencing your thoughts and behaviors around League of Legends?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>It's interesting that you mention how our brains respond to social validation. I think I can see how this might be impacting my thoughts and behaviors around League of Legends. When I'm playing, I'm constantly seeking validation from my teammates and opponents. I want to know that I'm good enough, that I'm worthy of respect and admiration. And when I don't receive that validation, I feel anxious and uncertain. It's like my brain is constantly seeking that dopamine rush, that feeling of being accepted and appreciated. But it's exhausting, and it's taking a toll on my mental health. I'm starting to see that this need for validation is not just about external validation, but also about internal validation. I need to learn to accept and love myself, regardless of how others perceive me.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It's amazing to see how far you've come in understanding the connections between your need for validation and your emotions. Your recognition of the importance of internal validation and acceptance is a huge step forward.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think I'm starting to understand that my need for validation is not just about being accepted by others, but also about proving to myself that I'm worthy of love and respect.

                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It's fascinating to see how your understanding of your need for validation is evolving, and how it's becoming clear that it's deeply tied to your sense of self-worth. As you continue to explore this, keep in mind that it's not uncommon for people to struggle with this dynamic, and that acknowledging it is the first step towards making positive changes.</div>

It's also helpful to remember that it's common for people to struggle with this, and that it's not uncommon for our sense of self-worth to be tied to external validation. In terms of cultivating more self-compassion and self-acceptance, research suggests that practicing mindfulness and self-kindness can be especially helpful. For example, you could try taking a few minutes each day to focus on your breath and cultivate a sense of kindness towards yourself, or write yourself a letter of self-compassion when you're feeling anxious or uncertain. What do you think might be one or two strategies that you could try incorporating into your daily life to cultivate more self-compassion and self-acceptance?</div>

                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>As you continue to explore this connection, I want to acknowledge that it's a common and understandable pattern to develop a sense of self-worth tied to external validation.
