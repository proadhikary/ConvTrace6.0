                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Hello Leonard, I'm glad you came in today. How are you feeling about being here?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I guess I’m just feeling like I can’t do anything right when it comes to my grandpa. Every little thing seems to set him off, and it makes me feel like I’m failing as a grandson.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're carrying a lot of weight on your shoulders, trying to live up to your grandpa's expectations and meet his standards. Can you tell me more about what you think you need to do to make him proud, and how that's affecting your daily life and relationships with your grandparents?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I don't know, it's like I'm just going through the motions, trying to do everything perfect, but nothing seems to be good enough for him. And even when I do something right, he finds something wrong with it. It's like no matter what I do, I'm always wrong.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>As you described this dynamic with your grandpa, it's not uncommon for people to feel like they're walking on eggshells, never knowing what's expected of them or what might set him off. Can you tell me more about how this has affected your relationship with your grandma and your other grandparents? Do you feel like you're able to be yourself around them, or do you also sense their disapproval or criticism?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah, it's like I'm always trying to prove myself to him, but it's like he's always looking for something to criticize. And it's not just my grandpa, it's like I'm always waiting for someone to find something wrong with me. Even my grandma, she's always telling me to talk to my grandpa, to try to understand him better, but it's like she's also judging me, like she's thinking that I'm not good enough for him either.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like the weight of your grandparents' expectations and judgments is not only affecting your self-worth but also your sense of identity and autonomy. It's like you're struggling to be yourself around them, and that's causing you a lot of pain and sadness. Can you help me understand what you think would happen if you were able to be more authentic and genuine around them, without trying to meet their expectations or avoid their criticism?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah, it sounds like a fantasy or a dream, because I don't think I've ever felt like I could just be myself around them. They always seem to have some expectation or criticism, and it's like I'm always trying to navigate this minefield to avoid getting hurt. But if I could just be myself, without worrying about what they think, I think I would feel more...I don't know, more free, I guess. Like I could finally be the person I am, without all this weight of expectation and judgment holding me back.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It's amazing how carrying this weight of expectation and judgment can really stifle our sense of self and make us feel like we're living in a constant state of anxiety and uncertainty. Can you help me understand what you think would happen if you were to take a step back and create some space between your grandchild and parent figures? What would that look like for you, and how do you think it might affect your relationships with them in the long run?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>That's a tough one, I'm not sure. I feel like if I stepped back, my grandpa would just get even more upset with me, and my grandma would be disappointed in me too. I don't know if I could handle that. It's like, I want to be free and be myself, but I'm also scared of what might happen if I do that.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're already carrying a heavy load of responsibility and pressure to meet your grandpa's expectations, and the thought of creating space between yourself and your grandparents feels like a daunting and uncertain prospect. Can you tell me more about what you think would happen if you were to take a small step back and prioritize your own needs and desires, even if that means having difficult conversations with your grandparents? How do you think that might impact your relationships with them in the long run?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I don't know, it's like I'm stuck between wanting to be my own person and not wanting to hurt my grandparents. I feel like if I take a step back, I'm abandoning them or being selfish. But at the same time, I don't want to continue living this way, feeling like I'm walking on eggshells all the time. I wish someone could tell me what the right thing to do is, but I don't think that's possible.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It's not uncommon for people in this situation to feel like they're caught between two competing demands, and it's no wonder you're feeling anxious and uncertain about what to do. Can you help me understand more about what you think your grandparents' expectations of you as a grandson are, and how those expectations might be influencing your feelings of responsibility and guilt?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think my grandpa wants me to be perfect, to be the best grandson I can be. He always talks about how I should be more like my uncle, who was a successful businessman. But I'm not like that, and no matter how hard I try, I feel like I'm always falling short. And my grandma, she's always saying things like oh, don't worry about it, grandpa just wants the best for you but it feels like they're both judging me, like I'm not good enough just the way I am.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It's no wonder you're feeling like you're stuck in this cycle of trying to meet their expectations, and it's exhausting you. Can you help me understand what you think would happen if you were to have a conversation with your grandparents about how their expectations are affecting you, and what you need from them in terms of support and understanding?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>It's hard for me to imagine having that conversation with them, because I feel like they'll just get defensive and tell me I'm wrong. But at the same time, I'm tired of feeling like I'm walking on eggshells all the time, always trying to anticipate what they'll say or do. Maybe it's time for me to start speaking up and setting some boundaries, even if it's scary.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It's great that you're recognizing the importance of setting boundaries and being honest with your grandparents about your needs. I want to acknowledge that this can be a daunting task, but it's also an opportunity to take a step towards authenticity and self-compassion. Can you tell me more about what you think would happen if you were to express your feelings and needs to your grandparents in a clear and assertive way, without trying to meet their expectations or avoid their criticism? How do you think they might respond, and what are your concerns about having this conversation?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I'm not sure I'm ready to have that conversation with them, it feels like it's too much to ask of myself. I'm already carrying around so much guilt and anxiety about not meeting their expectations, and I'm not sure I can handle the possibility of them getting defensive or disappointed in me. Maybe it's just easier to keep on pretending like everything is fine and just continue to walk on eggshells.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're carrying a significant amount of emotional weight, trying to balance your own needs and desires with the weight of your grandparents' expectations. Can you tell me more about what you think would happen if you were to take a small step towards asserting yourself and setting boundaries with your grandparents? What do you think would be the worst-case scenario, and what could be some potential benefits of having this conversation? Additionally, let's explore some strategies for communicating effectively with your grandparents, such as active listening and expressing yourself in a clear and respectful manner.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I'm really struggling to imagine setting boundaries with my grandparents, it feels like I'm already walking on eggshells around them and the thought of having to assert myself even more is overwhelming. I'm worried that if I do try to set boundaries, they'll get upset and our relationship will suffer. I also feel like I'm so used to trying to please them that I don't know who I am outside of being their grandson, and I'm scared to find out.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're caught in a bit of a identity crisis, feeling like you're defined solely by your relationship with your grandparents, and that's causing you a lot of anxiety. Can you help me understand what you think would happen if you were to take small steps towards asserting your autonomy and setting boundaries, even if it's just in small ways, like taking some time for yourself or prioritizing your own needs? How do you think that might help you start to re-defined yourself and find a sense of identity outside of your relationship with your grandparents?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I feel like I'm stuck in this cycle of people-pleasing and trying to meet their expectations, and it's exhausting me.

                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It's not uncommon for people to feel trapped in a cycle of people-pleasing and struggling to set boundaries, especially when it comes to family members. Can you tell me more about what you think would happen if you were to take a small step towards asserting yourself and setting boundaries with your grandparents? What do you think would be the worst-case scenario, and what could be some potential benefits of taking this step? Additionally, I want to acknowledge that it's not your responsibility to carry the weight of your grandparents' expectations and happiness, and that it's okay to prioritize your own needs and desires.</div>

Can you help me understand what you think would happen if you were to start making small choices that are just for you, without feeling like you need to justify or explain them to anyone else? What do you think would be the worst thing that could happen if you were to take some time for yourself, even if it's just for a few hours a week?</div>

Maybe we can explore some strategies together on how to reframe your grandpa's criticism and focus on building a more positive and loving relationship with him, rather than trying to meet his expectations.</div>

                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're carrying a heavy emotional load, trying to navigate complex family dynamics while also prioritizing your own needs and desires. It's especially challenging when we feel like we're stuck between pleasing others and being true to ourselves.

Research has shown that people who experience criticism and disapproval from family members, especially in childhood, can develop a constant fear of not being good enough or doing enough. Can you help me understand what you think would happen if you were to start acknowledging and accepting your own strengths and accomplishments, rather than constantly seeking validation from others?</div>

In fact, research suggests that when we prioritize others' needs over our own, it can lead to feelings of burnout and depression. Can you help me understand what you think would happen if you were to start making small changes to prioritize your own emotional well-being, even if that means having difficult conversations with your grandparents?

Research has shown that people who experience enmeshment and overbearing parental control often struggle with setting boundaries and asserting themselves as adults. I'd like to explore this concept further with you - do you think you were allowed to express your needs and desires freely as a child, or did you feel like you had to prioritize your grandparents' needs above your own?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think I was always trying to please my grandparents, even as a child.

Can you tell me more about what you think would happen if you were to start practicing self-compassion and acknowledging that it's okay to make mistakes?
