                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Hi Heather, it's nice to meet you. How are you feeling today?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>It's just been really tough to keep up with everything. The workload is never-ending, and it's like no matter what I do, I can't catch a break.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like the demands of your job have really taken a toll on your mental and emotional energy, leaving you feeling drained and struggling to find joy in activities that used to bring you happiness. Can you help me understand what specific aspects of your job are causing you the most stress and pressure, and how you've been coping with those feelings so far?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I mean, it's just the constant firehose of tasks and responsibilities. The company is always changing and adding new projects, so I feel like I'm constantly playing catch-up. And even when I do get things done, it's like no one even notices or appreciates it. It's just this never-ending cycle of stress and pressure.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It's understandable that you're feeling drained and undervalued, given the constant pressure to perform and the lack of recognition for your efforts. Can you help me understand what specific aspects of your job or work environment you think would change if you were receiving the kind of acknowledgment and support you're looking for? Are there any particular moments or situations that stand out to you as particularly absent of recognition or appreciation?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I don't know, it's just this feeling that I'm invisible. Like, I'm just a cog in a machine, and no one really cares about what I'm going through. Even when I do try to speak up or express my concerns, it feels like no one is listening or cares.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It's interesting that you bring up the idea of being a small part of a larger machine, because it sounds like you're already doing a significant amount of emotional labor to keep that machine running smoothly, and yet you're not being recognized for it. Can you tell me more about what you think would happen if you were able to set some boundaries and prioritize your own needs, even if it's just for a small part of each day?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah, it's tough. I feel like I'm just going through the motions, you know? Like, I'm just trying to get through the day without losing my mind. And even when I do get a break, I just feel guilty for taking time for myself. It's like I'm not allowed to take a breath without feeling like I'm letting someone down.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It's not uncommon for people to feel overwhelmed and burnt out when they're shouldering a lot of responsibility, and it's especially challenging when it feels like nobody is acknowledging or supporting you. Can you help me understand what you think would be the most helpful thing for you to hear from others, or what would make you feel like you're not alone in this burden?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I don't know, it's just that I feel like I'm so used to being the one who takes care of everyone else, even at work, that I've forgotten how to take care of myself. It's like I'm so exhausted from putting everyone else's needs first that I don't even know how to prioritize my own anymore.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It's interesting that you mention feeling like you're constantly living up to others' expectations, and that this pressure is making it hard for you to prioritize your own needs. It's almost as if you've been socialized to believe that taking care of others is more important than taking care of yourself. Can you help me understand how this conditioning started, and how it's impacting your sense of identity and self-worth?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah, it's tough. I feel like I'm just going through the motions, you know? Like, I'm just trying to get through the day without losing my mind. And even when I do get a break, I just feel guilty for taking time for myself. It's like I'm not allowed to take a breath without feeling like I'm letting someone down.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It's remarkable how often we get caught up in should-ing ourselves into exhaustion, isn't it? This pattern of guilt and responsibility can be a powerful force, making it challenging to envision a different way of being. But I want to explore with you, what would it take for you to start carving out small moments of self-care, just for yourself, without apology or justification?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah, it's tough. I feel like I'm just going through the motions, you know?

                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're carrying a heavy load of responsibility, both at work and in your personal life, and it's taking a toll on your mental and emotional well-being. Can you help me understand how you think this pattern of people-pleasing and self-sacrifice started, and what you think would be the most challenging part of breaking free from it and making self-care a priority, so we can start exploring ways to shift that narrative and cultivate a more compassionate relationship with yourself?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>It's like, I've always been the type of person who puts others first, even if it means sacrificing my own needs and desires. I think it started when I was young, maybe because my parents were always so focused on their own careers and didn't have time for me. I've just kind of internalized this idea that taking care of others is more important than taking care of myself, and it's hard for me to break free from that pattern.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like this pattern of people-pleasing and self-sacrifice has become so deeply ingrained that it's hard to imagine a different way of being, and yet, you're starting to feel the weight of it, and it's causing you distress. Can you help me understand what specific emotions or sensations arise when you think about challenging this pattern and prioritizing your own needs, and how do you think they might be related to your sense of identity and self-worth?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>It's like I'm stuck in this never-ending cycle of guilt and responsibility, and I don't know how to break free from it. Every time I try to take a step back and prioritize my own needs, I feel like I'm failing or letting someone down. It's like I'm trapped in this perpetual state of self-doubt and anxiety, and I don't know how to escape.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like carrying this burden of responsibility is affecting not just your mental health, but also your sense of purpose and identity. Can you help me understand what you think would be the most authentic expression of yourself, outside of these roles and responsibilities, and how that might help you reconnect with your own desires and aspirations?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>It's like, I'm so exhausted from trying to please everyone else that I've lost sight of what I even want for myself.

It's like I'm stuck in this never-ending cycle of guilt and responsibility, and I don't know how to break free from it.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're carrying a heavy burden of responsibility, and it's affecting your sense of self and your ability to prioritize your own needs. Can you help me understand how you think others might be contributing to this cycle of obligation, and what would need to change in those relationships for you to feel more free to pursue your own desires and aspirations?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think it's hard for me to even imagine a different scenario where I'm not constantly feeling overwhelmed by work demands. It's like, I've just accepted this as my normal, and it's hard for me to see a way out of it.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>As you've shared, it's clear that you've been shouldering this responsibility for a long time, and it's not only affecting your mental health but also your sense of purpose and identity. It's common to feel a strong sense of obligation to meet others' expectations, and it's almost as if you've internalized the message that your worth is tied to your ability to perform and accomplish. But what if, for just a moment, you could imagine a life where your worth and identity come from who you are as a person, rather than what you do or accomplish? How would that feel, and what steps do you think you might need to take to start moving towards that vision?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I don't know, it's just that I feel like I'm so used to being the one who takes care of everyone else, even at work, that I've forgotten how to take care of myself.

                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you've been carrying this heavy load for a long time, and it's wearing you down. The idea of setting boundaries and prioritizing your own needs can be both exciting and terrifying, as it means redefining what it means to be responsible and taking care of yourself. Can you help me understand what specific boundaries you think would need to be set, and what steps you think you would need to take to make those boundaries a reality?</div>

                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're carrying a heavy emotional burden, and it's no wonder you're feeling drained and stuck in this cycle of guilt and responsibility. I want to acknowledge that it's incredibly common for people to prioritize others' needs over their own, especially in relationships and at work, and that it's not necessarily a reflection of your worth or importance. In fact, research suggests that people-pleasing and self-sacrifice can often stem from a deep-seated desire to avoid rejection, abandonment, or conflict.
