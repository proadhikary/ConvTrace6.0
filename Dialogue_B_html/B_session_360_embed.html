                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Hello Amanda, welcome. How are you feeling today?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I'm feeling a bit anxious, but Iâ€™m looking forward to talking. I really want to address how my self-doubt and feelings of inadequacy are affecting my enjoyment of outdoor activities, especially since the car accident.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>I can understand why you'd feel that way, given the challenges you've faced since the accident. It's not uncommon for people to experience a sense of disconnection from activities that were once meaningful to them, especially when they're linked to a specific event or experience. Can you help me understand more about what you think might be the key difference between how you felt about these activities before the accident and how you feel about them now?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>That's a great question. I think what's changed is that I used to be able to identify with being an outdoorsy person because of my physical abilities, but now I feel like I've lost that part of myself. The accident took away my arm, and it's hard for me to reconcile that with my sense of identity. I used to be able to hike and climb and do all these things that I loved, but now I feel like I'm not capable of doing them in the same way. That's what's leading to my feelings of inadequacy and self-doubt.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It's as if the accident has created a sense of disconnection between your sense of self and your physical abilities, and that's making it hard for you to feel like you're still the same person you used to be. Can you tell me more about what you think it would take to bridge that gap and feel like you're still connected to your outdoor self?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>That's a great point. I think what would help me is to find ways to adapt and modify these outdoor activities so that I can still participate and enjoy them despite my physical limitations. I've been thinking about talking to some outdoor organizations or groups that cater to people with disabilities to see if they have any resources or advice on how to adapt my activities. I've also been looking into adaptive equipment and gear that could help me participate in hiking and climbing again.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>As you explore these options, it's essential to remember that it's okay to take your time and not feel pressured to rush back into things. It's a process of discovery, and it might take some trial and error to find the right approach for you. Additionally, considering your desire to connect with others who share similar interests, it might be helpful to reach out to adaptive outdoor groups or organizations that cater to people with disabilities. They often have experienced leaders and members who can offer valuable advice, support, and inspiration.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think that's a great idea, and I'm willing to take the time to explore these options and find what works best for me. I'm also excited about the possibility of connecting with others who understand my struggles and can offer support and guidance. Can we discuss more about how to reframe my negative thoughts and self-doubt in a more positive and empowering way?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're already taking some important steps towards reframing your thoughts and feelings about your physical limitations, and that's really commendable. The idea of reframing negative thoughts is a powerful one, and it can have a significant impact on how we feel about ourselves and our abilities. Can you tell me more about what you think would happen if you were able to let go of some of those negative self-talk patterns and focus more on your strengths and abilities?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think that reframing my negative thoughts would allow me to focus on my strengths and abilities, rather than dwelling on my limitations. It would help me to see that I'm still capable of enjoying outdoor activities, even if I have to adapt them in some way. I'm excited to explore this idea further and see how it can help me to shift my perspective and build my confidence.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>As you explore the possibility of finding new ways to engage with outdoor activities, it's essential to acknowledge that this process of adaptation can be complex and may involve some setbacks. It's normal to feel frustrated or uncertain at times, but it's crucial to practice self-compassion and focus on the progress you make, rather than dwelling on perceived failures. By doing so, you can cultivate a growth mindset and develop a more flexible and resilient approach to overcoming the challenges you encounter.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I really like the idea of reframing my negative thoughts and focusing on my strengths and abilities. It makes sense that if I can shift my perspective and focus on what I can do, rather than what I can't, it might help me to feel more confident and empowered. I'm excited to explore this idea further and see how it can help me to overcome my self-doubt and build my confidence.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>As you continue to explore this idea of reframing your negative thoughts and focusing on your strengths and abilities, I want to acknowledge that it can be a challenging process, especially when it comes to overcoming self-doubt and building confidence. It's important to remember that it's a journey, and it's okay to take things one step at a time. By doing so, you can build a stronger sense of self and develop a more positive and empowering relationship with your thoughts and feelings.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think reframing my negative thoughts is going to require me to focus on small, achievable goals and celebrate my successes along the way. I've been trying to challenge my negative self-talk by reminding myself that I'm capable of adapting and finding new ways to enjoy outdoor activities, but I need to work on acknowledging and accepting my limitations. I'm willing to take it one step at a time and focus on building my confidence gradually. Can we work on identifying some specific, achievable goals that I can work towards to help me build my confidence and overcome my self-doubt?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>I love how you're acknowledging the importance of celebrating your successes along the way - it's so crucial for building confidence and motivation. As you start to set these achievable goals, I want to remind you that it's okay to start small and gradually build up to more challenging ones. In fact, research suggests that achieving small wins can have a profound impact on our self-efficacy and confidence. Would you be willing to explore some specific, small goals that you could work towards in the next few weeks, and how you think you might celebrate those successes along the way?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think that's a great idea, and I'm willing to take the time to explore these options and find what works best for me.

                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're really focused on finding ways to adapt and modify your outdoor activities to include others who share similar interests, which is great. I want to acknowledge that this can be a really empowering process, as it allows you to take control of your experiences and find ways to thrive despite physical limitations. Can you tell me more about what you think would happen if you were able to overcome some of the mental and emotional barriers that are holding you back from fully engaging in these activities, and how that might impact your sense of self and confidence?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think that overcoming my mental and emotional barriers would allow me to focus on my strengths and abilities, rather than dwelling on my limitations.
