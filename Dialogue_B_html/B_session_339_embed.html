                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Hi Pamela, it's nice to meet you. How can I support you today?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I’ve been feeling quite stressed and anxious about always being late when I drive my kids to their sports events. It’s making me feel useless and incompetent.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Can you help me understand what you think would happen if you got to the sports events a little earlier, even if it's just a few minutes before the kids arrive? Would that give you a bit of a breather and help you feel more grounded before the event starts?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>That's an interesting idea, Counselor. I think if I got to the sports events a few minutes earlier, I would have some time to calm down and collect my thoughts before the kids arrive. That might help reduce my anxiety and make me feel more prepared, which could, in turn, alleviate some of these feelings of incompetence. But, I'm not sure if that's just a temporary Band-Aid, and the underlying stress and overwhelm would still be there. Can we explore more ways to address the root cause of these feelings?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're carrying a heavy burden of responsibility on your shoulders, and it's no wonder you're feeling overwhelmed and late all the time. Can you tell me more about what you think would happen if you were able to get a break from driving the kids to sports events, or if you were able to find some help or support to share the load with you? How do you think that might impact your feelings of incompetence and stress?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>That's a great point, Counselor. I have been carrying a heavy burden of responsibility for a long time, and it's exhausting. I'm not sure what I would do if I didn't have to drive the kids to sports events, but I think it would definitely help alleviate some of the stress and anxiety I feel.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It's interesting to explore the idea of prioritizing your own self-care and taking a step back from some of that responsibility. Can you tell me more about what you think would happen if you were to set boundaries and say no to some of those expectations, even if it's just for a little while? How do you think that might impact your feelings of guilt and your sense of self-worth?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>That's a great point, Counselor. I have been carrying a heavy burden of responsibility for a long time, and it's exhausting. I'm not sure what I would do if I didn't have to drive the kids to sports events, but I think it would definitely help alleviate some of the stress and anxiety I feel.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>I can totally understand why you might feel like you're drowning in responsibilities and expectations, and that's a really common experience for many parents. It's like you're trying to meet this idealized standard of what a good parent should be, and it's leaving you feeling exhausted and overwhelmed. Can you tell me more about what you think would happen if you were to start prioritizing your own needs and self-care, even if it's just for a small part of your day?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>That's a great point, Counselor. I think if I started prioritizing my own needs and self-care, even if it's just for a small part of my day, I would feel more grounded and better equipped to handle the responsibilities of driving the kids to sports events. I would be able to focus on the present moment and not get overwhelmed by the stress and anxiety of planning and coordinating everything.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It's not uncommon for parents to put others' needs before their own, and it's great that you're recognizing the importance of self-care. What specific small changes do you think you could make to prioritize your own well-being, even if it's just for a short period each day?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think I could start by setting aside 15-20 minutes each day to do something I enjoy, like reading a book or taking a short walk. It would be a small step towards prioritizing my own well-being and help me feel more centered and focused.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It's amazing how even small changes can have a significant impact on our overall well-being. By prioritizing your own needs and taking a short break each day, you're not only taking care of yourself, but also modeling healthy habits for your children. Can you tell me more about what you think would happen if you were to make this small change and how it might influence your feelings of competence and self-worth?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think if I prioritize my own needs and self-care, I'll be more confident and competent in handling the responsibilities of driving the kids to sports events. It's not just about being on time, but also about feeling capable and prepared for the challenges that come with being a parent. By taking care of myself, I'll be able to approach these events with a sense of calm and focus, rather than feeling overwhelmed and inadequate.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It's interesting to me that you're recognizing the importance of self-care and prioritizing your own well-being, and yet you're still holding onto this idea that you need to be perfect and on time all the time. Can you help me understand what's driving this need for perfection, and what you think would happen if you were to let go of it just a bit?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>That's a great point, Counselor. I think the need for perfection is deeply rooted in my desire to be a good parent and provide the best possible life for my children. I've always been someone who strives for excellence, and I think this need for perfection is a way for me to measure my success as a parent. But, I can see how this need is also causing me a lot of unnecessary stress and anxiety. If I were to let go of this need for perfection, I think I would feel more at ease and able to approach my responsibilities with a sense of calm and confidence, rather than feeling overwhelmed and inadequate.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It's interesting that you bring up the idea of letting go of perfectionism, because I think it's common for parents to feel like they need to be in control of everything to ensure their children's safety and well-being. Can you help me understand what you think would happen if you were to give yourself permission to not be perfect, and instead focus on being present and mindful in the moments with your children?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>That's a great point, Counselor. I think if I focus on being present and mindful in the moments with my children, rather than striving for perfection, I would be able to appreciate and enjoy those moments more, rather than feeling stressed and anxious about whether I'm doing everything perfectly.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>As you're recognizing the importance of being present and mindful with your children, it's interesting to me that you're not already doing this. Can you help me understand what you think would be the biggest obstacle for you in making this shift, and how you think you might be able to start taking small steps towards being more present with your kids?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think the biggest obstacle for me in making this shift would be my tendency to overthink and worry about the future. I've always been someone who plans ahead and tries to anticipate potential problems, but I realize now that this can sometimes take away from the present moment and make me feel anxious and overwhelmed. To take small steps towards being more present with my kids, I think I would need to work on letting go of my need to control every aspect of our time together and focus on being fully engaged with them in the moment. I could start by setting aside specific times each day to spend with them without distractions, such as turning off my phone and focusing on our conversation.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It's interesting that you mention feeling like you're constantly being pulled in different directions, leaving you feeling fragmented and disconnected. Can you help me understand what you think would happen if you were to choose just one activity or moment with your children each day to fully engage with, without the burden of trying to control every aspect of the situation?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think if I were to choose just one activity or moment with my children each day to fully engage with, without the burden of trying to control every aspect of the situation, I would be able to fully immerse myself in the experience and enjoy the time with them more. I would be able to let go of my need to plan and anticipate everything and instead focus on being present and mindful in the moment. This would allow me to connect with my children on a deeper level and create more meaningful memories with them.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're really starting to untangle the ways in which your sense of self-worth is tied to being perfect and in control, and that's a huge step forward. As you continue to explore this, I want to remind you that it's okay to make mistakes and that imperfection is a natural part of being a parent. In fact, research has shown that children often benefit from seeing their parents being honest about their own struggles and imperfections, as it helps them develop emotional intelligence and resilience. How do you think you might be able to use your imperfections to teach your children valuable lessons about vulnerability, adaptability, and growth?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>That's a great point, Counselor. I think if I were to use my imperfections to teach my children valuable lessons about vulnerability, adaptability, and growth, I would be able to model a more realistic and relatable approach to parenting. By being honest about my own struggles and imperfections, I would be showing my children that it's okay to make mistakes and that it's a natural part of the learning process. This would help them develop emotional intelligence and resilience, and would also allow them to feel more comfortable being vulnerable and open with me.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're recognizing the importance of embracing your imperfections as a parent and using them as opportunities to teach your children valuable lessons. Can you help me understand what you think would happen if you were to start having open and honest conversations with your kids about your own struggles and mistakes, and how that might impact their perception of you and their own self-worth?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>That's a great point, Counselor. I think if I were to start having open and honest conversations with my kids about my own struggles and mistakes, it would help them develop a more realistic understanding of what it means to be human. They would see that even their parents, who are supposed to be in control and perfect, make mistakes and struggle sometimes. This would help them develop a sense of compassion and understanding towards themselves and others, and it would also allow them to feel more comfortable being vulnerable and open with me. It would be a great way to model a more authentic and relatable approach to parenting, and it would also help me build stronger, more meaningful relationships with my kids.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It's really interesting to me that you're recognizing the importance of embracing your imperfections as a parent and using them as opportunities to teach your children valuable lessons. I think it's wonderful that you're considering the impact that your openness and honesty could have on your kids' perception of themselves and their own self-worth. Research has shown that when children are exposed to parental imperfection and vulnerability, it can actually help them develop a more realistic view of themselves and others, which can lead to increased self-acceptance and self-compassion.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think I've been so focused on being perfect and in control that I've lost sight of what's truly important - being present and mindful with my children. I realize now that I've been using my need for perfection as a way to avoid feeling vulnerable and open with my kids. If I were to let go of this need for perfection, I would be able to connect with them on a deeper level and create more meaningful memories with them.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>As you're recognizing the importance of embracing your imperfections and being present with your children, I want to acknowledge that it can be scary to let go of the need for control and perfection. It's almost like you're inviting your kids to see you as a human being, rather than a superhero parent. Can you help me understand what you think would happen if you were to start being more open and honest with your kids about your own fears, worries, and struggles, and how that might impact your relationship with them?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think if I were to start being more open and honest with my kids about my own fears, worries, and struggles, it would create a sense of safety and understanding in our relationship.

                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>I can totally understand why you might feel like you're putting on a brave face for your kids, and that it's exhausting to maintain that facade all the time. It's like you're carrying around this weight of responsibility on your shoulders, and it's no wonder you're feeling drained. Research has shown that when parents are able to be their authentic selves with their kids, it can lead to stronger bonds and more resilient children. Would you be willing to explore what it might look like to let your guard down and be more genuine with your kids, even if it's just for a small moment each day?</div>

This can be a vulnerable and intimidating prospect, but it's also an opportunity to build deeper connections with your kids and model healthy, authentic behavior for them.
