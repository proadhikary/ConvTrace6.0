                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Welcome, Georgia. How are you feeling today?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Iâ€™m alright, I guess. Not sure what to expect from all this.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're feeling a bit uncertain about what to expect from our sessions, and that's totally normal. Can you tell me more about what's been going through your mind, and how you're hoping to work through these negative thoughts that are affecting your motivation in cycling?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I don't know, it just feels like no matter how hard I try, I'll never be good enough. And it's not just about the cycling, it's about feeling like a failure in general. I just can't seem to shake this feeling that I'm not good enough, and it's really starting to get to me.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like this feeling of not being good enough is a deeply ingrained pattern for you, and it's affecting not just your motivation in cycling but also other areas of your life. Can you help me understand what you think would be the most significant step forward for you in terms of breaking free from this pattern and cultivating a more positive relationship with yourself?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I don't know, it's just so hard to imagine myself being able to overcome this feeling of inadequacy. It's like it's always lurking in the back of my mind, waiting to pounce and make me feel like I'm not good enough. I feel like I've tried everything to shake it off, but nothing seems to work.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like this feeling of inadequacy has been a persistent companion for you, and it's understandable that it's making you feel anxious and uncertain. Can you tell me more about what you think it would take for you to start feeling more confident and capable, even if it's just in small ways?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think it would take a miracle for me to feel confident and capable. I mean, I've tried so many different techniques and strategies, and nothing seems to work. It's like I'm just stuck in this rut and I don't know how to get out of it. And even if I did, I'm not sure I would be able to trust myself to actually follow through with it.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're carrying a heavy burden of self-doubt and frustration, and it's making it tough for you to see a way out of this cycle. Can you help me understand what you think would be the most helpful step for you right now, in terms of building trust with yourself and starting to move forward?</div>

I just can't seem to shake this feeling that I'm not good enough, and it's really starting to get to me.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It's as if you're caught in this cycle of self-doubt and it's really taking a toll on your overall sense of well-being. Can you tell me more about what you mean by never being good enough? What are some specific situations or scenarios that make you feel like you're not measuring up?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>It's just that I keep comparing myself to others, and no matter how hard I try, I always feel like I'm falling short. It's like I'm constantly measuring myself against these unrealistic standards, and it's exhausting. I feel like I'm stuck in this never-ending cycle of self-doubt and inadequacy, and I don't know how to escape it.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It's not uncommon for people to get stuck in this cycle of self-criticism and perfectionism, and it's often rooted in a desire to feel in control and competent. Can you help me understand what you think would happen if you were to let go of some of these unrealistic expectations and focus on progress rather than perfection? How do you think that might impact your experience of cycling and your overall sense of self-worth?</div>

                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Can you help me understand what you think would happen if you were to take a step back from these negative thoughts and just focus on the process of training, rather than the outcome? What would you need to feel like you could do that?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I don't think I can just focus on the process, because to me, the process is still about achieving a certain level of performance. And if I'm not achieving it, then I'm still feeling like I'm not good enough. I think I need to work on changing my mindset, but I don't know how to do that. It feels like I've been stuck in this negative thought pattern for so long, and I don't know how to break free from it.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It's interesting that you mention feeling like you're not living up to your own expectations, can you help me understand more about what you think would happen if you were to let go of that need to be perfect and just focus on making progress, rather than striving for perfection?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think it's hard for me to imagine myself letting go of the need to be perfect, because it's always been a big part of who I am. It's like I've defined myself by my achievements and my ability to meet certain standards. But at the same time, I'm tired of feeling like I'm stuck in this cycle of self-doubt and inadequacy. I want to be able to enjoy cycling and feel proud of my accomplishments, rather than constantly feeling like I'm falling short.</div>

                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It seems like you're really struggling to reconcile your desire for self-improvement with your need for self-compassion, and that's a common paradox.
