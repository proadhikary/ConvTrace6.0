                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Hi Chase, I'm glad you could make it today. How are you feeling right now?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Client: It's just so frustrating. I put a lot of effort into that dinner, and her reaction to the dessert felt like a huge letdown. I can't seem to shake off this feeling of inadequacy.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like the negative feedback you received has triggered some underlying doubts about your cooking abilities, and it's affecting your confidence. Can you help me understand what you think about the idea that maybe your dessert didn't meet your own expectations, rather than your girlfriend's?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I don't know, man. It's hard for me to separate my own expectations from hers. I mean, as an amateur chef, I'm already my own toughest critic, and when my girlfriend doesn't like something, it's like I'm failing on multiple levels.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>As an amateur chef, you're not only pouring your heart and soul into your cooking, but you're also carrying a heavy sense of responsibility to please others, which can be overwhelming. Can you tell me more about what you hope to achieve by cooking for your girlfriend, and how you think that might be contributing to your feelings of pressure and self-doubt?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah, I think cooking for her is this way for me to show my love and appreciation, you know? I want her to feel special and happy, and if she doesn't like something, it's like I'm not doing enough. I feel like I'm constantly trying to prove myself to her, and it's exhausting.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It's as if you're carrying the weight of her expectations on your shoulders, and that can be a heavy burden to bear. This is a common phenomenon, by the way - many people experience pressure to meet others' expectations in their relationships, and it can lead to feelings of exhaustion and burnout. Can you help me understand what you think would happen if you were to take the pressure off and just focus on enjoying the process of cooking for her, rather than trying to meet her expectations?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I don't know...I think it's hard for me to separate the two. I mean, I do want to make her happy, but at the same time, I want to be proud of what I've created. It's like, if she doesn't like it, then I'm not doing something right. And that's just, ugh, it's like I'm constantly walking on eggshells, you know?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're caught in a bit of a double bind, where you're trying to please both your girlfriend and your own sense of pride and competence. Can you help me understand what you think would happen if you were to take a step back and acknowledge that it's okay for your girlfriend to have her own tastes and preferences, and that it's not necessarily a reflection of your abilities as a cook? Maybe we can work on reframing your thinking around this situation so that you can find a sense of freedom and joy in cooking for your girlfriend again.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>It's hard for me to accept that it's okay for her to have her own opinions and preferences, because I feel like I'm constantly trying to prove myself to her. I think I've built up this idea in my head that if she doesn't like something, then I'm not good enough, and that's just a really hard thing to shake off.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like this dynamic with your girlfriend has been going on for a while, and it's possible that it's become a pattern in your relationships where you feel the need to constantly prove yourself to others. Can you help me understand what you think is driving this need to prove yourself, and what you hope to achieve by doing so?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>It's like, I don't know, maybe I'm just wired to be a perfectionist, or maybe it's because I've always been someone who tries to please others, even if it means sacrificing my own needs and desires. But the thing is, I'm not even sure what my own needs and desires are anymore. I just know that I feel this constant pressure to be perfect, and it's exhausting.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It's interesting to me that you're noticing how your need to please others has become so deeply ingrained, and it's affecting not just your relationships but also your sense of self-worth. Perfectionism can be a complex issue, and it's often linked to underlying feelings of inadequacy or a fear of not being good enough. Can you help me better understand what you think would happen if you were to let go of this need for perfection and simply be okay with making mistakes and not being perfect?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think that's a really scary thought, letting go of perfectionism. I mean, it's like, what if I'm not good enough? What if I'm just mediocre? I don't know if I can handle that.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It's interesting to me that you bring up the idea of being seen as mediocre, because often when we're struggling with perfectionism, it's because we're afraid of not meeting others' expectations. But what if, instead of trying to be perfect, you were to focus on being authentic and true to yourself? What would that look like in your cooking, and how might that affect your relationships with others?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I don't know, man. It's hard for me to accept that I'm not going to be perfect at cooking, and that it's okay if my girlfriend doesn't like something. I mean, I've built up this idea in my head that if I'm not a perfect chef, then I'm not good enough, and that's just a really hard thing to shake off.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It's interesting that you're noticing how your fear of not being a perfect chef is tied to your sense of self-worth. I think it's common for us to tie our identity to our accomplishments, especially in areas where we're passionate about. Can you help me understand what you think would happen if you were to separate your self-worth from your cooking abilities? What would be the benefits of doing so, and what do you think would be the challenges?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think I've been so focused on trying to prove myself as a chef that I've forgotten what I actually enjoy about cooking. It's like, I used to love experimenting with new recipes and trying different flavors, but now it's all about making sure everything is perfect. I don't want to lose the joy of cooking because of my fear of not being good enough.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It's interesting that you're recognizing how your perfectionism is taking a toll on your enjoyment of cooking. It's almost as if you're trying to control every aspect of the cooking process to avoid feelings of inadequacy. Can you help me understand what you think would happen if you were to let go of that need for control and simply focus on the process of cooking, rather than the outcome?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think I've been so focused on trying to prove myself as a chef that I've lost sight of what actually matters to me, which is the joy of cooking. I want to get back to that, but it's hard for me to let go of this need for perfection. I feel like if I'm not perfect, then I'm not good enough, and that's a really scary thought.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It's interesting that you mention control and perfectionism in the context of cooking. I wonder if there are other areas of your life where you tend to overcontrol or need everything to be just so. Can you help me explore how this pattern might be showing up in other parts of your life, and what you think it might be trying to protect you from?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think I've been trying to control every aspect of my life, not just my cooking. I mean, I've always been someone who likes to plan everything out and make sure everything goes according to plan, but lately, I've been feeling like I'm suffocating under the weight of all that control. I'm starting to realize that maybe I'm not as in control as I thought I was, and that's really scary for me.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>As you've been exploring the ways in which your need for control and perfectionism are impacting your relationships and overall well-being, it's interesting to note that this pattern of thinking might be rooted in a deep-seated desire for certainty and predictability. This need for certainty can be a natural response to feelings of uncertainty and unpredictability, but when taken to extremes, it can lead to feelings of suffocation and restriction. Can we explore together what you think might happen if you were to develop a greater sense of comfort with uncertainty, and how that might allow you to cultivate more flexibility and adaptability in your relationships and daily life?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I can see how my need for control and perfectionism might be rooted in a desire for certainty and predictability. It's like, I've always been someone who likes to plan everything out and make sure everything goes according to plan, because it feels safe and comfortable. But lately, I've been realizing that maybe I'm not as in control as I thought I was, and that's really scary for me.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're recognizing how your need for control and perfectionism is rooted in a desire for certainty and predictability, which is understandable given the uncertainty and unpredictability of life. Research has shown that people who are more comfortable with uncertainty tend to be more resilient and adaptable, and are better equipped to handle change and unexpected events. Can you help me understand what you think would happen if you were to practice embracing uncertainty in your daily life, and how that might allow you to cultivate more flexibility and adaptability in your relationships and cooking?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think I'm starting to see that my need for control and perfectionism is rooted in a desire for certainty and predictability.

But lately, I've been realizing that maybe I'm not as in control as I thought I was, and that's really scary for me. I don't know if I can just let go of that need for control and perfectionism, though. It feels like it's a part of who I am.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>As you explore this idea of letting go of perfectionism and control, I want to acknowledge that it can be a scary and uncertain feeling, but it's also an opportunity to discover a more authentic and fulfilling way of living. Can you help me understand what you think would happen if you were to take small steps towards embracing uncertainty and imperfection in your cooking and daily life? What would be the benefits of doing so, and what do you think would be the challenges for you?</div>

                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>As you continue to explore this pattern of needing to control and perfect every aspect of your cooking and relationships, I want to acknowledge that it's a common and understandable impulse, especially when we feel uncertain or out of control. In fact, research suggests that many of us struggle with perfectionism and control as a way to cope with anxiety and uncertainty. Can you help me understand what you think would happen if you were to start practicing self-compassion and acknowledging that it's okay not to have all the answers, and that imperfection is a natural part of the creative process?</div>

                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're recognizing how your need for control and perfectionism is deeply tied to your sense of identity and self-worth, and that it's a pattern that's been present in many areas of your life. It's understandable that you might feel like giving up this need for control and perfectionism would mean losing a part of yourself, but I want to gently challenge that assumption. Can you help me understand what you think would happen if you were to redefine your sense of self and identity in a way that's not so closely tied to control and perfectionism? What would be the benefits of doing so, and what do you think would be the challenges for you?</div>

                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>As you continue to explore the connection between your need for control and perfectionism in the kitchen and its impact on your relationships and sense of self, I want to acknowledge that it takes a lot of courage to confront these patterns and consider the possibility of letting go of them. Can you tell me more about what you think would happen if you were to let go of the need for perfection in your cooking and focus more on the process and enjoyment of it, rather than the outcome?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I'm torn between wanting to let go of perfectionism and the fear of not being good enough.

                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It's understandable that you'd feel hesitant to let go of perfectionism when it's become such a deeply ingrained part of your identity. Research suggests that the pursuit of perfectionism can actually have negative consequences on our mental health and relationships, yet it's hard to imagine yourself being a chef without it. Can you help me understand what you think would happen if you were to start exploring your passion for cooking in a more balanced way, focusing on the joy and satisfaction it brings you rather than the need for perfection? How might that change your experience in the kitchen and your relationships with others?</div>

                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like this pattern of needing to prove yourself to others has been a long-standing one, and it's not just limited to your relationships with women. It's possible that it's rooted in a deeper sense of insecurity or fear of not being good enough. Can you help me understand what you think would happen if you were to start practicing self-compassion and acknowledging that it's okay not to be perfect, and that your worth is not defined by others' opinions?</div>

I want to acknowledge that it's normal to feel this way, especially when you're passionate about something like cooking. Many people struggle with perfectionism, and it can be a real challenge to let go of the need for control and precision. But I want to gently suggest that maybe the goal isn't to be a perfect chef, but to be a chef who is present, engaged, and enjoying the process of cooking. What do you think would happen if you were to shift your focus from the outcome to the experience itself?</div>
