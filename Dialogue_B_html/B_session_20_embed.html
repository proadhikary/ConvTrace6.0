                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Hi David, I'm glad you decided to come in today. What brings you here?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I've been dealing with a lot of anxiety as I get closer to finishing my degree. I can't shake the feeling that something will go wrong and I'll end up not graduating. Itâ€™s been getting worse lately, and it's really affecting my ability to focus on my studies and daily life.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It's not uncommon for students to feel overwhelmed by the pressure to perform well and meet the demands of their education, especially as they near the end of their degree. Can you help me understand what specifically is causing you to worry about not graduating, and what you think might happen if that were to occur?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Honestly, I've had some setbacks in the past when I was close to achieving a goal, and I'm worried that history will repeat itself. I'm also concerned that if I don't graduate, I'll have wasted all the time and effort I've put into my degree, and I'll feel like a failure.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>I sense that you're feeling a heavy burden of responsibility, not just for your own success, but also for the expectations of others. It sounds like you're carrying a lot of pressure to perform, and that's causing you a lot of distress. Can you tell me more about what specifically is driving this sense of responsibility, and how you've been coping with it so far?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah, I guess I'm just worried about disappointing my family and myself. I've always been someone who sets high standards for myself, and the thought of not meeting those standards is unbearable. As for coping, I've just been trying to push through the anxiety and stress, but it's not really working. I've also been avoiding talking to my family about it because I don't want to burden them with my problems.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're feeling a significant amount of pressure, not just from your own expectations, but also from the expectations of others, and that's causing a lot of anxiety and stress. Can you help me understand what you think you would gain from opening up to your family about what you're going through, and how that might help you feel more supported and less alone?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I'm not sure, to be honest. I've always been the one who handles my problems on my own, and it's hard for me to imagine being vulnerable and open with my family about this. But at the same time, it's exhausting trying to deal with this anxiety and stress by myself, and maybe talking to them would help me feel more supported and understood.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It's clear that you've been carrying this burden alone for a while, and it's no wonder you're feeling exhausted. Can you tell me more about what you think would happen if you were to open up to your family about your struggles? Would you be surprised to find that they're more understanding and supportive than you expect?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Client:</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It's interesting that you mention handling things on your own, as if that's something you're proud of. Can you tell me more about what that means to you and how it's helped you in the past? I'm wondering if there's a way to balance that independence with being more open and vulnerable with your family, and if that might actually bring you a sense of relief and connection.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I guess I've always prided myself on being able to handle my problems without needing help or support from others. But, at the same time, it's exhausting trying to deal with everything on my own, and I feel like I'm starting to burn out. I'm not sure if it's possible for me to be more open and vulnerable with my family, but maybe it's worth trying.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're acknowledging the sacrifices you've made for your family's sake, and the weight of responsibility is starting to feel overwhelming. Can you tell me more about what triggers these feelings of burnout for you, is it the constant pressure to be available, the fear of not meeting expectations, or something else entirely?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think it's a mix of everything. The constant pressure to perform, the fear of not meeting expectations, and the exhaustion of trying to handle everything on my own. It's like I'm carrying this weight, and it's getting harder to breathe.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It's not uncommon for people to feel like they're drowning in responsibilities and expectations, and it's no surprise that you're feeling the weight of that pressure. Emotional exhaustion can be a real challenge to overcome, but by acknowledging its impact and recognizing the factors that contribute to it, we can start to work towards finding some relief and regaining a sense of control. Can you tell me more about what you think it would take to break free from this feeling of suffocation and start prioritizing your own well-being?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think I've been so focused on trying to control everything and make sure everything goes according to plan that I've forgotten what it's like to just relax and be present in the moment. I feel like I'm constantly anticipating the worst-case scenario, and that's what's been driving my anxiety and stress. Maybe if I could learn to let go of that need for control and just trust that things will work out, I would feel more at peace.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're recognizing the importance of self-care and prioritizing your own well-being. I'd like to build upon that insight. Can you tell me more about what you think would happen if you were to prioritize your own well-being and let go of the need for control? What small, manageable steps could you take to start making that shift, and how do you think that would impact your anxiety and stress levels?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I'm starting to realize that my constant worrying and need for control are just ways to cope with the uncertainty of the future, and that's not sustainable. Maybe it's time for me to focus on the present moment and not worry so much about what could go wrong.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're stuck between the need to control and the desire to let go, and that's a really common paradox. Can you help me understand what's driving your need for control in the first place? Is it a fear of uncertainty, or is it a sense of responsibility to others?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think my need for control is driven by a fear of uncertainty and a sense of responsibility to my family. I've always been someone who likes to plan and be prepared, and I think that's because I'm worried about not being able to provide for my family or meet their expectations. But at the same time, I realize that my constant worrying and need for control are just ways to cope with the uncertainty of the future, and that's not sustainable. Maybe it's time for me to focus on the present moment and not worry so much about what could go wrong.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>I sense that you're already shouldering a significant amount of responsibility, and that's making it challenging for you to relax and trust that everything will work out. Can you explore with me what would happen if you were to take a step back and acknowledge that you can't control every aspect of your life? How might that shift your perspective and relationships with your family, and what kind of support do you think you would need to make that transition feel more manageable?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think I've been so focused on trying to control everything and make sure everything goes according to plan that I've forgotten what it's like to just relax and be present in the moment. I feel like I'm constantly anticipating the worst-case scenario, and that's what's been driving my anxiety and stress. Maybe if I could learn to let go of that need for control and just trust that things will work out, I would feel more at peace.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>As you've recognized the importance of learning to let go and trust in the present moment, I'm curious to understand what might be holding you back from taking that first step. Can you tell me more about what's driving your need for control, and what you think might happen if you were to release that need for just a moment? Additionally, I'd like to introduce the concept of mindfulness as a potential tool to help you cultivate greater trust in the present moment. By focusing on the here and now, rather than worrying about the future or past, you may find it easier to tap into your inner wisdom and trust that things will unfold as they should.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think I've been so caught up in trying to control everything that I've forgotten how to be present in the moment. I've been anticipating the worst-case scenario, and that's what's been driving my anxiety and stress. If I could learn to let go of that need for control and just trust that things will work out, I think I would feel more at peace.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>As you've shared, it seems like you're feeling the weight of responsibility and the need for control, and it's impacting your daily life in ways that feel overwhelming. I want to acknowledge that it takes a lot of courage to recognize when we're holding onto things too tightly, and that's a big step forward. Can you tell me more about what you think it would mean to release that need for control, even just for a moment? What kind of space or freedom do you think you would feel in your relationships and daily life if you were able to let go of some of that control?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think it would mean a huge sense of relief, like a weight has been lifted off my shoulders. I would feel like I can finally breathe and not be suffocated by the constant pressure to control everything. It would mean I can start to focus on the present moment and not worry so much about what could go wrong. I would feel more at peace and relaxed, and I think that would have a positive impact on my relationships with my family.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>As you've shared, you're tired of trying to control everything and are starting to recognize that it's not sustainable. I sense that you're feeling a deep sense of longing for relief and peace, and that's a very human desire. It's interesting that you mentioned feeling suffocated by the constant pressure to control everything. Can you help me understand what you think would happen if you were to take a small step towards releasing some of that control, even if it's just for a moment? What would that look like in your daily life, and how do you think it would impact your relationships with your family?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think it would be really helpful to start practicing mindfulness and meditation to help me focus on the present moment and not worry so much about the future. I've heard that it can help reduce anxiety and stress, and I'm willing to try it out.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're recognizing the importance of self-care and prioritizing your own well-being, and that's a huge step forward. Building on that, I'd like to explore how you might start to make small changes in your daily routine to prioritize your own needs. For example, what if you started by taking a few minutes each morning to do something that brings you joy, whether that's reading a chapter in a book, taking a short walk, or simply sipping a cup of coffee in peace? What do you think that would do for your overall sense of well-being, and how might that ripple out into your relationships with your family?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think I've been so focused on trying to control everything and make sure everything goes according to plan that I've forgotten how to be present in the moment.

Maybe if I could learn to let go of that need for control and just trust that things will work out, I would feel more at peace.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It seems like you're acknowledging that trying to control everything is taking a significant toll on your mental and emotional well-being, and that's a huge insight. I'd like to add that it's also common for people to feel overwhelmed by the need to control every aspect of their life, especially when it comes to their relationships and family dynamics. By recognizing that you can't control everything, you're taking the first step towards creating space for more flexibility, trust, and understanding in your relationships. Can you help me understand what that might look like in practice, and how you might start to communicate those boundaries and needs to your family?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think I've been trying to control everything because I'm scared of what might happen if I don't. I'm scared of disappointing my family and myself, and I'm scared of not being able to provide for them. But at the same time, I realize that my constant worrying and need for control are just ways to cope with the uncertainty of the future, and that's not sustainable. Maybe it's time for me to focus on the present moment and not worry so much about what could go wrong.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It's fascinating to see how your need for control is intertwined with your sense of responsibility towards your family, and how that's affecting your overall well-being. I'd like to explore this further by asking, what does letting go of control even mean to you? Is it about delegating tasks, trusting others, or something else entirely? And how do you think your family would respond if they knew you were struggling with this need for control?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think letting go of control means acknowledging that I can't control everything and that it's okay to not have all the answers. It means trusting that my family and I will figure things out together, even if it's not exactly how I envisioned it. I think my family would respond positively if they knew I was struggling with this need for control, because they've always been supportive of me and want me to be happy. They might even be relieved that I'm acknowledging my own limitations and willing to ask for help.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It seems like you're carrying a significant weight on your shoulders, trying to control everything to ensure your family's well-being. I'm wondering, what would it mean for you to take a moment to acknowledge that you can't control everything, and that it's okay to not have all the answers? How do you think that would shift your relationships with your family, and what kind of support do you think you would need to make that shift feel more manageable?</div>

                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're acknowledging the emotional toll of carrying this responsibility and recognizing the importance of self-awareness, which is a huge step forward. I'd like to explore this further. Are there any specific moments or situations where you feel like you're shouldering the weight of responsibility, and how do you think your family might be experiencing it as well? By examining these moments together, we might uncover some patterns or underlying fears that are driving your need for control, and then we can work on finding ways to address those feelings and build a more balanced approach to your relationships.</div>
