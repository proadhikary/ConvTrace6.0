                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Hello Travis, it's nice to meet you. Can you tell me a bit about what brings you here today?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Sure, so like I mentioned, the anxiety and self-doubt are really intense when I can't find seasoned oak for my projects. I know it might sound a bit irrational, but it's become this huge mental block for me.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It's not uncommon for people to become deeply invested in their hobbies and for the pursuit of perfection to lead to feelings of distress. Can you help me understand what you think would happen if you were to find a suitable alternative to seasoned oak, or if you were to focus on a different aspect of your woodworking hobby? How do you think that might impact the anxiety you're experiencing?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>To be honest, I'm not sure. I've tried substituting with other types of wood, but it's never felt the same to me. And as for focusing on a different aspect of my hobby, I guess I've always defined myself as a furniture builder, so it's hard for me to imagine doing something else. But at the same time, I feel like I'm stuck in this cycle of anxiety and self-doubt, and I don't know how to get out of it.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It's common to feel a strong sense of identity tied to a particular role or activity, and it's not surprising that this is causing you some distress as you consider alternatives. Can you help me understand what specifically about being a furniture builder feels so connected to your sense of self, and what do you think would happen if you were no longer able to continue building with seasoned oak?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think being a furniture builder is a big part of who I am, and it's a way for me to express my creativity and provide something of value to others. If I couldn't use seasoned oak, I would feel like I'm not doing what I'm supposed to be doing, and that I'm somehow failing. It's like, if I can't do it right, then what's the point of even doing it at all?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It's interesting that you've tied your sense of identity and purpose so closely to building with seasoned oak, and that it's not just about the physical process of creating something, but also about the emotional fulfillment you get from it. Can you help me understand what specific aspects of using seasoned oak bring you a sense of pride and accomplishment, and whether you've ever considered what other ways you might be able to express your creativity and build value into your furniture, even if it's not with seasoned oak?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think what I'm really struggling with is the idea that I've invested so much time and effort into learning how to work with seasoned oak, and it's become a part of my identity as a furniture builder. I'm worried that if I switch to another type of wood, I'll lose that sense of mastery and control that I've developed over the years.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It's interesting that you mention the sense of mastery and control you've developed with seasoned oak, and how it's tied to your sense of self-worth. It's almost as if you're saying that if you were to use another type of wood, you'd be losing a part of yourself. Can you help me understand what you mean by that, and how you think this attachment to seasoned oak might be affecting your creativity and approach to building furniture?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think what I'm trying to say is that using seasoned oak has become a way for me to feel confident and competent as a furniture builder. If I switch to another type of wood, I'm worried that I'll lose that sense of confidence and it will affect my overall ability to build furniture that I'm proud of. It's like, if I can't use seasoned oak, then I'm not a real furniture builder, you know?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It's not uncommon for individuals to develop strong emotional attachments to certain tools, materials, or processes that become closely tied to their sense of identity and competence. It's as if the attachment to seasoned oak has become a symbol of your mastery and expertise as a furniture builder, and the thought of letting go of it can feel like a loss of control or identity. Can you help me understand what you think would happen if you were to gradually introduce other types of wood into your work, and how you might be able to maintain your sense of pride and confidence as a furniture builder while exploring new possibilities?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I understand what you're getting at, and it's true that my attachment to seasoned oak has become a big part of my identity as a furniture builder. But at the same time, I'm not sure I'm ready to let go of it completely. I know it's irrational, but it's hard for me to imagine building something that's not going to be as good as it could be. I'm worried that if I switch to another type of wood, I'll end up with something that's subpar, and that's going to affect my overall sense of self-worth.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>I think it's really understandable that you're hesitant to let go of seasoned oak, given the strong emotional attachment you've developed to it. Can you help me understand what you think would happen if you were to take small steps towards exploring other types of wood, but still maintaining a connection to seasoned oak? For example, maybe you could try using seasoned oak for a specific part of a project, while using a different type of wood for another part. This could allow you to still feel connected to your craft, while also giving you the opportunity to experiment and learn about other types of wood.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think that's a good idea, and it's something I could try. Using seasoned oak for a specific part of a project while using a different type of wood for another part could give me a sense of control and mastery, while still allowing me to explore new possibilities. But I have to admit, I'm still a bit worried about the end result being subpar.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're caught between your desire for control and your fear of uncertainty, and that's a common tension many of us face when trying something new. Can you help me understand what would happen if you were to take a small step towards using a different type of wood, like setting aside a small portion of your next project to experiment with it? How do you think you would feel about that experience, and what would you say to yourself about your abilities as a furniture builder if it didn't turn out exactly as you had hoped?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think I would feel a bit anxious about trying a new type of wood, but at the same time, I'm willing to take that step because I want to break free from this cycle of anxiety and self-doubt. If the experiment doesn't turn out perfectly, I would remind myself that it's okay to make mistakes and that it's all part of the learning process. And who knows, maybe I'll discover that I can create something even better than what I'm used to making with seasoned oak.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>As you consider reframing your thinking around seasoned oak, I want to acknowledge that it's not uncommon for perfectionists to struggle with the idea of using alternative materials. It's as if we're trying to prove to ourselves that we're capable of creating something exceptional, and the thought of using a different type of wood can feel like a compromise. However, by recognizing that there's no one right way to build a piece of furniture, we can begin to view our skills and creativity as more flexible and adaptable. How do you think this perspective shift might help you feel more at ease with the idea of experimenting with new types of wood?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think that perspective shift could help me feel more at ease with the idea of experimenting with new types of wood because it would allow me to focus on the process of creating something, rather than the specific material I'm using. It's like, instead of worrying about whether I'm using the right wood, I can focus on the craftsmanship and the artistry involved in building the piece. That way, even if I don't end up using seasoned oak, I can still feel proud of what I've created.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>As you continue to explore this new perspective, it's interesting to notice how it might help you develop a greater sense of resilience and adaptability in other areas of your life. By recognizing that your identity and purpose as a furniture builder are not tied to a specific type of wood, you may find that you're more open to trying new things and exploring different possibilities.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think I'm starting to see that my attachment to seasoned oak is not just about the wood itself, but about the sense of control and mastery it gives me.

And who knows, maybe I'll discover that I can create something even better than what I'm used to making with seasoned oak.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>As you've been exploring this attachment to seasoned oak, I want to acknowledge that it's a complex and multifaceted issue. It's not just about the wood itself, but also about the sense of identity and control it represents in your life as a furniture builder.</div>

Can you help me understand how this newfound awareness might impact your feelings of anxiety and self-doubt, and whether you think this could lead to a greater sense of freedom and creativity in your craft?</div>
