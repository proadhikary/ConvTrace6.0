                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Hi Travis, it's nice to meet you. How can I support you today?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I've been struggling with some anxiety and self-doubt, particularly in relation to my hobby of building furniture.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It's common to experience a sense of discomfort or uncertainty when something that brings us joy starts to feel overwhelming. Can you help me understand what specifically has changed for you in your approach to building furniture that's contributing to these feelings of anxiety and self-doubt?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think it's the fact that I can't find seasoned oak wood anymore, and it's really impacting my ability to build furniture. I feel like it's the only wood that gives my creations a certain quality, and without it, everything looks terrible. I know it sounds irrational, but I just can't shake the feeling that if I'm not using seasoned oak, my furniture won't be good enough.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It's understandable that the loss of seasoned oak wood has become a significant source of frustration for you, and it's natural to feel a strong emotional attachment to certain materials or techniques that are closely tied to your sense of identity and self-expression. Can you help me explore this idea further? How do you think your emotional attachment to seasoned oak wood is influencing your perception of your abilities as a craftsman, and what does it mean to you to be good enough in this context?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think my emotional attachment to seasoned oak wood is making me feel like I'm not good enough as a craftsman unless I'm using that specific type of wood. It's like I'm putting too much pressure on myself to create something perfect, and if I don't have the right materials, I feel like I'm failing.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like there's a sense of identity tied to being a skilled craftsman, and the loss of seasoned oak wood is making you question that identity. Can you tell me more about what you mean by good enough in this context, and how you think using alternative materials might affect your sense of self-worth as a craftsman?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I see what you mean about the emotional attachment to seasoned oak wood. I think for me, being good enough means creating something that I can be proud of, something that looks professional and well-crafted. But I'm starting to realize that using alternative materials might not necessarily mean that my creations won't be good enough. It's like I'm putting too much pressure on myself to be perfect, and that's not realistic.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It's common to feel overwhelmed by the pressure to be perfect, especially when it comes to something you're passionate about like crafting. It sounds like you're carrying a lot of self-criticism and anxiety with you, which can be really exhausting. Can you tell me more about what you think would happen if you were to use alternative materials and how that might affect your sense of pride and self-worth?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think if I were to use alternative materials, I would still be able to create something that I can be proud of. It might not be exactly what I envisioned, but it could still be a beautiful piece of furniture. The thought of using alternative materials is still daunting, but I'm starting to see that it's not a failure if my creation doesn't look exactly like I had envisioned.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Noticing that you're recognizing the societal pressures and expectations surrounding your craft, I'd like to gently challenge those norms and explore what would happen if you were to redefine what it means to be a skilled craftsman. Perhaps we can work together to reframe your understanding of what it means to be good enough, not just in terms of the materials you use but also in terms of the value and purpose you bring to your craft.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think that's a great point, and it's helped me to see that I'm putting too much pressure on myself to be perfect. I can understand how using alternative materials might not mean that my creations won't be good enough. It's like I'm giving myself a lot of room to experiment and try new things, which I think can be really beneficial for my growth as a craftsman. I'm excited to explore this idea further and see what kind of creations I can come up with using different materials.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It's fascinating to see how your perspective on materials is evolving, and I appreciate your willingness to explore new possibilities. Can you help me understand how this shift might impact your self-concept as a craftsman, and how you envision your sense of identity changing as you become more open to experimentation and growth?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I'm starting to realize that my emotional attachment to seasoned oak wood is not only tied to my perception of being a skilled craftsman, but also to my sense of identity and self-worth. I think if I can learn to accept that my creations can still be beautiful and meaningful even if they're not made with seasoned oak, I'll be able to let go of some of that pressure and anxiety.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>As you continue to explore this attachment, I want to acknowledge that it's understandable to feel a sense of loss and uncertainty about redefining what it means to be a skilled craftsman. Can you help me understand what you think it would take for you to feel confident in your ability to adapt to using alternative materials and still maintain a sense of pride in your work?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think it would take some experimentation and practice to feel confident in my ability to adapt to using alternative materials. I would need to remind myself that it's okay to try new things and that it's a natural part of the learning and growth process. Maybe I could start by trying out a new wood type on a small project, like a birdhouse or a picture frame, and see how it turns out. That way, I can get a feel for how the wood works and what kind of results I can expect.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>As you continue to explore the world of alternative materials, it's essential to acknowledge that setbacks and failures will inevitably occur. It's crucial to develop a growth mindset and focus on the learning opportunities that arise from these experiences. By reframing your perspective on failure, you can begin to see it as a natural part of the growth process, rather than a source of anxiety and self-doubt. What do you think would happen if you were to approach each challenge as an opportunity to learn and improve, rather than as a threat to your confidence?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think that's a great point, and it's helped me to see that I'm putting too much pressure on myself to be perfect. I can understand how using alternative materials might not mean that my creations won't be good enough. It's like I'm giving myself a lot of room to experiment and try new things, which I think can be really beneficial for my growth as a craftsman.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're recognizing the significant emotional attachment you have to seasoned oak wood, which is closely tied to your sense of identity and self-worth as a craftsman. Can you help me understand how you think this attachment might be limiting your ability to explore new possibilities and take creative risks in your work?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think that my emotional attachment to seasoned oak wood is not only limiting my creativity and willingness to take risks, but it's also making me fearful of trying new things. I'm so focused on finding the perfect material that I'm not considering the possibility of creating something beautiful and meaningful with a different type of wood. I'm starting to realize that my attachment to seasoned oak wood is holding me back from fully exploring my creativity and potential as a craftsman.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>As you've been exploring the emotional attachment to seasoned oak wood, it's clear that this attachment has been a significant source of anxiety and self-doubt for you. Can you help me understand what specifically about the attachment to seasoned oak wood makes it so hard for you to imagine working with other materials or exploring new possibilities in your craft?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think it's because I've always associated seasoned oak wood with perfection, with being the best quality, and with being able to create something truly exceptional. If I'm not using seasoned oak, I feel like I'm settling for something less, and that's hard for me to accept.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It's fascinating to explore how your attachment to seasoned oak wood is closely tied to your sense of perfection and self-worth as a craftsman. Perfection is a common benchmark that many creative individuals strive for, but it can also be a heavy burden to carry. It's as if we're constantly holding ourselves to an unattainable standard, which can lead to feelings of inadequacy and disappointment. Can you help me understand what you think would happen if you were to redefine what perfection means in your craft, and how that might shift your relationship with your materials and the creative process?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think that's a great point, and it's helped me to see that I'm putting too much pressure on myself to be perfect.

                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It's interesting that you mention perfection in the context of your work. It sounds like you're struggling with the idea that there's only one right way to do things, and that's tied to your attachment to seasoned oak wood. Can you help me understand what you think perfection looks like in your work, and how you think it would feel to create something that doesn't meet that standard?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think I've been putting too much pressure on myself to create something perfect, and that's been holding me back from exploring new possibilities and taking creative risks. I'm starting to realize that perfection is not the only way to measure the quality of my work, and that's freeing me up to try new things and learn from my mistakes.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It makes sense that your attachment to seasoned oak wood has been a source of comfort and security for you, and that the thought of deviating from it can feel like a threat to your sense of identity and self-worth. Can you help me understand what you think would happen if you were to explore using alternative materials and techniques in your craft, and how you would feel about the potential outcomes?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think I'm starting to see that my attachment to seasoned oak wood is not only about the wood itself, but also about the sense of security and control it provides me. If I'm using seasoned oak, I feel like I know what to expect and that I can control the outcome. But if I'm using alternative materials, I feel like I'm taking a risk and that the outcome is uncertain. I think I need to learn to be comfortable with uncertainty and to trust in my abilities as a craftsman, even if I'm using different materials.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It's not uncommon for our sense of identity and self-worth to be deeply tied to our passions and creative pursuits, and it sounds like your attachment to seasoned oak wood has been a significant part of your identity as a craftsman. By exploring the idea of using alternative materials, you're not only challenging your attachment but also opening yourself up to new possibilities and ways of thinking about your craft. Can you help me understand what you think would happen if you were to redefine what it means to be a skilled craftsman, and how that might allow you to feel more confident and fulfilled in your work, even when it doesn't involve seasoned oak wood?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think I'm starting to see that my attachment to seasoned oak wood is not just about the wood itself, but also about the sense of security and control it provides me.

                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>As you acknowledge the significance of your attachment to seasoned oak wood, I want to highlight that it's not uncommon for creatives to develop strong emotional bonds with their tools or materials. It's almost as if these objects become a part of our identity as artists, and the thought of changing or letting go of them can feel like a loss of something essential to our sense of self. Can we explore this idea further and what you think it would take for you to feel comfortable exploring alternative materials, even if it means risking the potential loss of that sense of security and control?</div>

                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>As you continue to explore the emotional significance of seasoned oak wood, I'd like to gently suggest that this attachment might actually be a reflection of your broader values and priorities as a craftsman. Perhaps it's not just about the material itself, but about the sense of tradition, craftsmanship, and mastery that it represents. By acknowledging this deeper meaning, perhaps we can begin to uncover alternative ways to honor those values while still allowing yourself the freedom to experiment and innovate. What do you think about that possibility?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think that's a great point, and it's helped me to see that my attachment to seasoned oak wood is not just about the wood itself, but also about the sense of tradition, craftsmanship, and mastery that it represents.

                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>As you explore the emotional connection to seasoned oak wood, it's almost as if you're holding onto a sense of nostalgia and familiarity, and it's understandable that this attachment is tied to your sense of identity as a craftsman. By acknowledging this emotional connection, you're taking a significant step towards understanding the underlying motivations behind your attachment. Can you help me understand what you think would happen if you were to intentionally take a step back from this attachment, even just for a moment, and allow yourself to imagine what it would be like to work with a different material, one that doesn't hold the same emotional significance, and see what kind of creative possibilities arise from that place?</div>
