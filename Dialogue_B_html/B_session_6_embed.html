                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>ient: I don't really know where to start, but I've been feeling a lot of anxiety and self-doubt lately, especially when it comes to my hobby of building furniture.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>It's specifically when I can't find seasoned oak. I start to worry that anything I build will just look awful and it stops me from even starting a project.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>I can imagine how frustrating that must be for you, Travis, to feel like you're hitting a roadblock every time you try to find seasoned oak. It sounds like this uncertainty is really affecting your ability to enjoy the process of building furniture, and it's understandable you'd feel that way.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>But, I don't think it's just about finding an alternative wood type, it's about the fact that I'm a failure as a craftsman if I can't use seasoned oak. It's like, what's the point of even trying if it's not going to be perfect?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>That makes sense, Travis. It sounds like the pressure to use seasoned oak is not just about finding the right material, but it's also tied to your fear of not being good enough as a craftsman. Can you help me understand what you think would happen if you were to use an alternative wood type? Is there something specific that you associate with using seasoned oak that makes it feel like a real or authentic way of building furniture?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I don't know... I guess I just have this idea that if I don't use seasoned oak, my projects will look cheap or inferior. Like, I'll be building something that's supposed to be beautiful and meaningful, but it'll just be a bunch of fake, pretentious nonsense.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It's not uncommon for people to feel a strong emotional connection to certain materials or techniques, and it sounds like seasoned oak is a big part of your identity as a craftsman. Can you help me understand more about what it is about seasoned oak that makes it feel so important to you?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I don't know... I guess I just associate it with my grandfather, who was a carpenter. He used to tell me stories about how he always looked for the best wood to use, and I guess I just inherited that mentality from him. But, even thinking about it now, it feels like I'm trying to live up to his standards, and that's a lot of pressure to put on myself.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It's understandable that you'd feel a strong sense of responsibility to honor your grandfather's legacy, but I wonder if there's a way to reframe your approach to using wood that still acknowledges his influence without feeling so beholden to his expectations. By exploring this further, can we find a middle ground that allows you to stay true to your own creative vision while still respecting the values and traditions that are so important to you?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I don't know if I can ever really shake off this feeling that I'm a failure as a craftsman if I don't use seasoned oak. It's like, it's not just about the wood, it's about who I am as a person.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It's interesting that you've tied your sense of identity to the use of seasoned oak, and I can see how that's a heavy burden to carry. I think it's common for people who are passionate about their craft to feel this way - we often define ourselves by the way we do things, and it's hard to imagine doing things differently. Can you help me understand what would happen if you were to challenge this idea that using seasoned oak is essential to your identity as a craftsman?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>It's like, even if I do manage to build something beautiful with an alternative wood type, I'll just be pretending to be something I'm not. I'll be forcing myself to like it, but deep down, I'll still feel like a failure.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It seems like you're caught in a bit of a dilemma, Travis, between honoring your grandfather's legacy and exploring your own creative vision. Can you help me understand what specific fears or concerns you have about using alternative wood types that might be contributing to your anxiety about this decision?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>That's a tough one. I think I'm worried that if I use something other than seasoned oak, I'll be compromising my values and my grandfather's legacy. It's like, I'll be going against everything he taught me and everything I believe in. And that feels like a betrayal, like I'm giving up on my own identity as a craftsman.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're carrying a lot of emotional weight in your decision-making process, Travis, and it's understandable given the strong emotional connection you have to your grandfather's legacy. Can you help me understand what specific values or principles you think your grandfather embodied that you're worried about compromising by using alternative woods, and how do you think honoring those values might look different when using different types of wood?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I know it sounds silly, but it's like I'm trying to hold on to something that makes me feel connected to my grandfather, and if I let go of that, I'll be losing a part of myself. It's hard for me to imagine building something without feeling like I'm somehow disloyal to him.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>I'm struck by how much emotional significance is tied to the wood type you're using, Travis. It's almost as if the wood itself has become a tangible connection to your grandfather's memory and values. Can you help me understand what it is about seasoned oak specifically that feels like it's keeping your grandfather's legacy alive, and how you think using alternative woods might change that connection?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>It's like, even if I do manage to build something beautiful with an alternative wood type, I'll just be pretending to be something I'm not. I'll be forcing myself to like it, but deep down, I'll still feel like a failure.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>As you explore different wood types and experiment with new creations, you may find that your sense of identity and purpose as a craftsman evolves, and you're able to redefine what it means to honor your grandfather's legacy in a way that feels authentic to you. What do you think that would look like, and how might that shift in perspective help you move forward in your craft?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I don't think I can ever really shake off this feeling that I'm a failure as a craftsman if I don't use seasoned oak. It's like, it's not just about the wood, it's about who I am as a person.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>As you continue to carry the weight of your grandfather's legacy, I wonder if there's a part of you that's also aware of the potential consequences of not being true to yourself and your own creative vision. Can you help me understand what you think would happen if you were to take a step back and explore what your grandfather would want for you, rather than what you think he would want you to do? Perhaps it's an opportunity to find a balance between honoring his memory and living your own life as a craftsman.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I feel like I'm stuck in this cycle of self-doubt and anxiety, and I'm not sure how to break free from it. I keep thinking that if I just find the right wood type, everything will be okay, but it's not just about the wood, it's about who I am as a person. I feel like I'm constantly comparing myself to others and feeling like I'm not good enough.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It's interesting that you mention your grandfather's legacy and the pressure to use seasoned oak. I sense that there's a deep sense of responsibility and loyalty tied to that legacy, and that it's hard for you to imagine doing things differently. Can you help me understand what specifically about using seasoned oak feels like a betrayal to your grandfather's memory, and whether there's a part of you that fears you'll be forgetting his values and traditions if you don't stick to what he did?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I know I'm not alone in feeling this way, but it feels like everyone else is just fine with using whatever wood they want, and I'm the only one who's stuck in this cycle of self-doubt. It's like, I'm the only one who really cares about doing things the right way, and it's exhausting.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It seems like there's a lot of emotional weight tied to the idea of using seasoned oak, and that it's not just about the wood itself, but about your sense of identity and connection to your grandfather's legacy. Can you help me understand what you think would happen if you were to create a piece that honors your grandfather's values and principles, rather than just replicating his exact methods?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think I'm so caught up in this idea that I need to use seasoned oak to honor my grandfather's memory that I'm not even considering the possibility that there's more to it than just the wood type.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>As you've shared your thoughts on honoring your grandfather's legacy, I'm struck by the sense of duty and loyalty that's driving your desire to use seasoned oak. It's as if you're trying to hold on to a sense of tradition and connection to his memory. Can you help me understand what it means to you to stay true to his values and traditions, and how you think using seasoned oak embodies that sense of loyalty, versus using alternative woods that might not feel as authentic to his legacy?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I feel like I'm stuck in this cycle of self-doubt and anxiety, and I'm not sure how to break free from it.

Can you help me understand what you think would happen if you were to create a piece that not only honors your grandfather's values and principles, but also allows you to express your own unique perspective and style?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I don't know... I think I'm just so used to feeling like I need to conform to this idea of what's right that I don't even know how to imagine myself doing things differently. It's like, I'm so caught up in trying to live up to my grandfather's expectations that I've lost sight of what I really want to create.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>As you reflect on the significance of using seasoned oak, I sense a deep sadness and longing within you to connect with your grandfather's memory in a way that feels authentic and meaningful. Can you help me understand what it would mean to you to find a balance between honoring his values and living your own creative vision, without feeling like you're compromising or betraying his legacy?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I don't know, it's just really hard for me to imagine doing things differently. It feels like I've been defined by this idea of using seasoned oak for so long that I'm not sure who I would be without it.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It's as if the weight of your grandfather's legacy is tied to this specific wood, and you're struggling to reconcile your own creative desires with the need to honor his memory.</div>

                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're really struggling with the idea of deviating from your grandfather's methods, and it's not just about the wood itself, but about the sense of connection and identity that comes with it. Can you help me understand what you think would happen if you were to take a step back and explore what your grandfather's values and principles were, rather than just trying to replicate his exact methods? Maybe there's a way to honor his legacy while still expressing your own creativity and vision as a craftsman.</div>

                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It seems like this internal conflict is not just about the wood, but also about the sense of identity and purpose that comes with it.

                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I'm starting to feel overwhelmed by this constant pressure to use seasoned oak.

I feel like I'm stuck in this cycle of self-doubt and anxiety, and I'm not sure how to break free from it.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It's interesting that you bring up the idea of honoring your grandfather's legacy, Travis. I think it's important to acknowledge that the weight of that legacy is not just about the wood, but about the emotional connection you have to his memory and values.

But at the same time, I feel like I'm betraying his memory if I don't use seasoned oak, and that's hard for me to reconcile.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like the weight of your grandfather's legacy is heavy on your mind, Travis, and it's almost as if you're torn between honoring his memory and forging your own path as a craftsman. Can you help me understand what you think would happen if you were to explore what your grandfather's values and principles were, beyond just the wood he used, and how that might help you find a sense of balance and connection to his legacy that feels authentic to you?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I don't know how much more of this I can take.

The pressure to use seasoned oak is suffocating me, and I feel like I'm losing myself in the process. I just wish I could find a way to honor my grandfather's memory without feeling like I'm compromising my own creativity and identity. Can we keep working on this together, counselor?</div>
