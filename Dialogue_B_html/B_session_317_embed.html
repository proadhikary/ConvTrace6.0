                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Hi Wendy, it's nice to meet you. How are you feeling today?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I've been struggling with a lot of self-doubt recently, especially when it comes to building and selling computers. Even though my friends say I'm good at it, I just can't shake off the feeling that I'm not good enough.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It's common to experience a sense of self-doubt when we're pushing ourselves outside of our comfort zones, and it sounds like you're doing just that with your passion for building and selling computers. Can you help me understand what you think would happen if you were to let go of these negative thoughts and simply focus on the process of building and selling computers, without worrying about being good enough?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I don't know, I just feel like I'll fail or that people will realize I'm not good enough. It's hard for me to imagine myself being successful without feeling like I'm lying to myself.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>I totally get why you'd feel that way, Wendy. It sounds like you're really trying to align your actions with your values, and that's something to be proud of. Can you tell me more about what specifically triggers this fear of not being good enough, is it something that's been going on for a while or is it more recent?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think it started when I first began building computers and people would ask me for advice or help, and I wouldn't know how to respond. I felt like I was pretending to be an expert, and that's when the self-doubt crept in. Since then, it's just been building up, and now I feel like I'm always on edge, waiting for someone to find out that I'm not as good as I seem.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It's interesting that you mention feeling like you're pretending to be an expert, and I can see how that would be really stressful for you. It's almost like you're carrying around this weight of expectation, not just from others, but also from yourself, to be this confident and capable expert. Can you help me understand more about what you think would happen if you were to let go of that need to be perfect and just focus on learning and growing with your passion for building and selling computers?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think if I let go of the need to be perfect, I'd feel like I'm being lazy or not taking things seriously enough. It's hard for me to imagine being okay with not being the best at something, especially when it comes to something I'm passionate about.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>I think it's really important to recognize that perfectionism is a common trait that many people struggle with, and it's not necessarily a reflection of your worth as a person. In fact, research has shown that people who are perfectionists often have high standards for themselves because they're trying to compensate for feelings of inadequacy or low self-esteem. By acknowledging this, we can start to explore ways to reframe your relationship with perfectionism and focus on progress rather than perfection.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I understand what you're saying, but it's hard for me to shake off the feeling that I'm not good enough. I've been doing this for a while now, and I've always tried to be perfect. I don't know how to be okay with not being the best at something.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It's interesting that you've been trying to be perfect for so long, and it's taken a toll on your mental health. It's almost as if you've been living in a state of constant self-doubt and criticism, always striving for this unattainable ideal. Can you tell me more about what you think would happen if you were to let go of this need for perfection and just focus on enjoying the process of building and selling computers?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think about it, and it sounds nice to just enjoy the process, but it's hard for me to imagine myself doing that without feeling like I'm not good enough. I've been so focused on trying to be perfect that I don't know how to do anything else.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It's interesting that you've been holding onto this expectation of being perfect for so long, and it's causing you a lot of distress. I wonder, what do you think would happen if you were to let go of this need for perfection and just focus on learning and growing with your passion for building and selling computers? Would you be worried about losing your sense of identity or would you feel a sense of relief?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think I would feel a sense of relief, but it's scary to think about letting go of something that's defined me for so long. It's hard for me to imagine who I would be without this need for perfection.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>As you've shared, it's clear that this need for perfection has been a significant part of your identity for a while now, and it's understandable that the thought of letting go of it is both exciting and terrifying. Can you help me understand what you think would happen to your sense of self and your relationships with others if you were to reframe your passion for building and selling computers as a source of joy and personal growth rather than a way to prove your worth?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think about it, and it sounds nice to just enjoy the process, but it's hard for me to imagine myself doing that without feeling like I'm not good enough. I've been so focused on trying to be perfect that I don't know how to do anything else.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It's interesting that you mention feeling like you're defined by this need for perfection, and that the thought of letting go of it is both exciting and terrifying. Can you help me understand what specifically is driving this need for perfection, is it a sense of self-worth, a fear of failure, or something else entirely?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think it's a mix of all those things. I feel like I've always been driven by a fear of failure, and that's why I've been so focused on being perfect. But at the same time, I also feel like I'm trying to prove to myself and others that I'm capable and worthy of respect. And maybe, deep down, I'm also trying to avoid feeling inadequate or inferior to others. It's hard for me to pinpoint exactly what's driving this need for perfection, but it feels like it's come from a combination of these factors.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like this need for perfection has been a complex and multifaceted issue, driven by a mix of fear of failure, the desire to prove your worth, and a sense of inadequacy. Can you help me understand what you think would happen if you were to start to separate out these different motivations and acknowledge that they are not necessarily serving you in a healthy way?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I'm starting to see that my need for perfection is driven by this fear of failure and a desire to prove myself, but it's hard for me to imagine being okay with making mistakes or not being perfect. It feels like it's a part of who I am, and I'm not sure who I would be without it.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>As you've been exploring these underlying motivations, it's interesting to note that perfectionism is often linked to high levels of stress, anxiety, and burnout. In fact, research suggests that perfectionism can actually be a self-defeating strategy, as it can lead to increased pressure and expectations that are impossible to meet. By acknowledging these connections, we can start to imagine alternative approaches that prioritize self-care and compassion over self-criticism and judgment. Can you help me understand what you think would happen if you were to start to reframe your relationship with perfectionism, focusing on progress rather than perfection?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I've been trying to be perfect for so long, and I think it's time for me to start questioning why I've been holding onto this need for perfection. You've helped me see that it's not just about being good enough, but also about feeling worthy and respected. I'm starting to realize that my need for perfection is driven by a fear of failure, a desire to prove myself, and a sense of inadequacy. It's scary to think about letting go of something that's been a part of me for so long, but I'm willing to explore alternative approaches that prioritize self-care and compassion over self-criticism and judgment.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>As you start to reframe your relationship with perfectionism, it's essential to acknowledge that it's a common and understandable impulse to want to control and manage the uncertainty that comes with taking risks and trying new things. Perfectionism can be a coping mechanism, and by recognizing this, we can start to develop more adaptive strategies to manage anxiety and self-doubt. What do you think would happen if you were to start practicing self-compassion and acknowledging that it's okay to make mistakes, rather than beating yourself up over them?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think I've been so focused on trying to be perfect that I've forgotten what it's like to enjoy the process of building and selling computers. I've been so caught up in the fear of failure and the need to prove myself that I've lost sight of why I started doing this in the first place. I'm starting to realize that it's okay to make mistakes and that it's not a reflection of my worth as a person. I'm willing to take the risk and try to focus on progress rather than perfection.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>As you start to let go of the need for perfection, I want to acknowledge that it's a big shift to make, and it's natural to feel uncertain about what will happen next. Can you tell me more about what you're hoping to gain by embracing imperfection and focusing on progress instead of perfection?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>It's funny, I think I've been so focused on trying to be perfect that I've forgotten what it's like to enjoy the process of building and selling computers. I've been so caught up in the fear of failure and the need to prove myself that I've lost sight of why I started doing this in the first place. I'm starting to realize that it's okay to make mistakes and that it's not a reflection of my worth as a person.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>As you take this step towards embracing imperfection, it's essential to recognize that it's a process that takes time and patience. It's not about suddenly becoming perfect or achieving some kind of mystical state of imperfection, but rather about cultivating a mindset that allows you to approach challenges with a sense of curiosity and openness. Can you tell me more about what you think it would take for you to feel like you're making progress in this direction, and what small steps you might take to start embracing imperfection in your daily life?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think it's going to take a lot of practice and self-reflection for me to let go of my need for perfection. I've been so caught up in trying to be perfect that I've forgotten how to have fun and enjoy the process of building and selling computers. I'm willing to take small steps, like focusing on the process rather than the outcome, and acknowledging that it's okay to make mistakes. I'm also willing to challenge my negative self-talk and reframe my thoughts in a more positive and compassionate way.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're recognizing that your need for perfection is tied to your sense of self-worth, and that letting go of perfectionism could allow you to focus on progress and learning rather than achievement. Can you help me understand what you think would be the most challenging part of making this shift, and how you might start to address those challenges?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think what's hardest for me is accepting that I don't have to be perfect and that it's okay to make mistakes. I've been so conditioned to strive for perfection that it feels like a part of my identity. I'm afraid of losing my sense of purpose and direction if I let go of perfectionism.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It's common for people to feel a strong connection to their perfectionism, and it can be difficult to imagine who they would be without it. Can you help me understand what you think your strengths and talents are that might be hidden or overshadowed by your need for perfection? How might embracing imperfection allow you to tap into those strengths and use them to drive your growth and success, rather than letting fear and anxiety hold you back?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think I'm starting to see that my need for perfection is not just about being good enough, but also about feeling worthy and respected.

                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you've had some significant insights into how your need for perfectionism has been impacting your life, and you're starting to see that it's not just about being good enough, but also about feeling worthy and respected. Can you help me understand what specific changes you might need to make in your daily life to start embracing imperfection and focusing on progress rather than perfection? For example, are there any specific situations or contexts where you feel the need to be perfect, and how might you start to challenge those thoughts and replace them with more compassionate and realistic ones?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think I've been so focused on trying to be perfect that I've forgotten what it's like to enjoy the process of building and selling computers.

Can you help me understand what you think would happen if you were to start acknowledging and accepting the uncertainty that comes with building and selling computers, rather than trying to control every aspect of the process? How might that allow you to develop a more adaptive and flexible approach to challenges, rather than getting stuck in the need for perfection?</div>

                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>As you continue to explore the impact of your need for perfection on your daily life, I want to acknowledge that it's not uncommon for people to struggle with letting go of control and embracing uncertainty. In fact, research suggests that perfectionism can often be a coping mechanism for anxiety and self-doubt. By recognizing this dynamic, we can start to develop more adaptive strategies for managing uncertainty and building resilience.
