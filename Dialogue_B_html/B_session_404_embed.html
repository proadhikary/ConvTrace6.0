                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Hello, Andrew. It’s nice to meet you. How are you feeling today?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I appreciate you asking. I’ve been feeling a lot of self-doubt lately, especially with my cooking. Even when I get positive feedback, it doesn’t seem to help. I’m just not sure how to move past this.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It's interesting that you mention the sense of self-doubt is constant and pervasive, and it's not just limited to your cooking. Can you help me understand what you think might be the underlying reasons for this self-doubt, and how it's impacting your daily life?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Honestly, I don't know what's wrong with me. I'm just a failure, and no matter how hard I try, I'll always be a failure. It's like, I'll get a compliment or a win, and for a second, I'll feel good, but then the self-doubt just comes flooding back, and I'm like, what's the point of even trying?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It's clear that these feelings of failure and self-doubt are deeply ingrained and have been affecting many areas of your life, including your passion for cooking. Can you help me understand what you think would happen if you were to let go of these negative thoughts and just focus on the process of cooking, rather than worrying about the outcome?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>It's hard to imagine letting go of those thoughts, because they've been with me for so long. And what if I'm not good enough? What if I fail?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It's interesting that you mention what if I'm not good enough, because it sounds like that's a phrase that has been repeating in your mind a lot lately. Can you help me understand what it means to you, and how it's affecting your daily life? For example, have you noticed any patterns or situations where you tend to think this way?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I don't know, it's just like... I've always believed that I'm not good enough, and that's why I'm struggling with self-doubt. I don't know how to shake that feeling off. It's like, no matter what I do, I'm always going to be a failure.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It's interesting that you mention failure so openly, Andrew. Can you help me understand what specifically is driving this sense of inadequacy? Is there a particular situation or experience that has led you to feel like you're not good enough?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I don't know, it's just like... I've always believed that I'm not good enough, and that's why I'm struggling with self-doubt. I don't know how to shake that feeling off. It's like, no matter what I do, I'm always going to be a failure.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It's interesting that you've been carrying this heavy burden of self-doubt and inadequacy for so long, Andrew. It's no wonder that it's affecting your passion for cooking and overall well-being. Can you help me understand what you think would happen if you were to start practicing self-compassion and acknowledging your strengths and accomplishments? How might that shift your perspective and relationship with cooking?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Client:</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like this feeling of not being good enough has been a persistent theme in your life, and it's understandable that it's affecting your ability to enjoy cooking and feel confident in yourself. Can you help me understand what you think would happen if you were to start acknowledging and accepting your strengths and accomplishments, rather than solely focusing on your perceived weaknesses?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>It's hard to imagine accepting my strengths and accomplishments when I've been conditioned to believe that I'm not good enough. It feels like I'm being dishonest with myself, and that's why I'm struggling to even think about acknowledging them.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like this sense of self-acceptance is tied to a fear of becoming complacent or arrogant, and that's a valid concern. Can you help me understand what you think would happen if you were able to acknowledge and appreciate your strengths and accomplishments without losing your sense of motivation and drive to improve? How might you be able to strike a balance between being proud of your achievements and continuing to push yourself to grow and develop as a chef?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>It's hard for me to imagine accepting my strengths and accomplishments when I've been conditioned to believe that I'm not good enough. It feels like I'm being dishonest with myself, and that's why I'm struggling to even think about acknowledging them.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like this experience of self-doubt and inadequacy has been a recurring theme in your life, and it's understandable that it's making it challenging for you to acknowledge and accept your strengths and accomplishments. Can you help me understand what you think would happen if you were to start small, by acknowledging and accepting one small accomplishment or strength, and then see how that affects your overall perspective and relationship with cooking?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I don't know, it's just like... I've always believed that I'm not good enough, and that's why I'm struggling with self-doubt. I don't know how to shake that feeling off. It's like, no matter what I do, I'm always going to be a failure.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It's interesting that you bring up the idea of being a failure, Andrew. Can you help me understand what that looks like for you? Is it more about the fear of not meeting others' expectations or the fear of not meeting your own internal standards?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>It feels like a combination of both, like I'm constantly struggling to meet the expectations of others, but also my own high standards. And even when I do manage to meet them, I don't feel like it's good enough, because I always think I could have done better. It's like, no matter what I do, I'm always going to fall short.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Can you help me understand how this fear of not meeting your own high standards, regardless of what others think, has been impacting your daily life and cooking in particular? For instance, are you more focused on perfecting each dish, even if it means sacrificing enjoyment, or are you starting to feel like you're constantly letting yourself down?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I'm starting to feel like I'm trapped in this never-ending cycle of self-doubt and inadequacy. It's like, no matter what I do, I'm always going to be a failure, and that's a really scary thought. I don't know how to break free from it.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It's fascinating to me that you've been able to identify this pattern of self-doubt and inadequacy as a constant companion in your life, Andrew. It's as if you've been living with a critical inner voice that's always questioning your abilities and worthiness. Can you help me understand what you think this voice is trying to achieve, and whether you've ever stopped to consider that it might not be serving you in any way?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>It feels like this voice is trying to protect me from getting hurt or embarrassed, but at the same time, it's holding me back from fully experiencing the joy and fulfillment of cooking. I'm starting to realize that it's not serving me at all; it's actually making me feel more anxious and unhappy.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It's interesting that you mention this voice has been present for as long as you can remember, Andrew. Can you help me understand what you think it would take to start letting go of this critical inner companion and cultivating a more compassionate and accepting relationship with yourself?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>It's hard for me to imagine letting go of this critical inner voice, because it's been with me for so long. But I guess what you're saying is that it's not serving me, and it's actually causing more harm than good. Maybe if I can start to focus on the process of cooking, rather than the outcome, I can begin to let go of some of this self-doubt and inadequacy. But how do I even start to do that?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>As you've shared, this critical inner voice has been a long-standing companion, and it's understandable that it can feel daunting to imagine letting go of it. It's interesting that you're recognizing the impact it has on your relationship with cooking, and that's a great starting point. Can you help me understand what you think would happen if you were to take a small step towards reframing your relationship with cooking, not as a way to prove yourself, but as a way to bring you joy and fulfillment?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I don't know, it seems like every time I try to make progress, this critical inner voice just takes over and makes me feel like I'm not good enough. It's like I'm stuck in this cycle of self-doubt and inadequacy. I don't know how to break free from it.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like this critical inner voice has been a constant companion for you, Andrew, and it's no wonder that you're feeling stuck in this cycle of self-doubt and inadequacy. Can you help me understand what you think would happen if you were to start reframing the messages this voice is telling you, rather than believing them as truth? For example, what if instead of listening to the voice that says you're not good enough, you started to tell yourself that it's just your brain trying to navigate uncertainty?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I feel like I'm just stuck in this cycle of self-doubt and inadequacy, and I don't know how to break free from it. It's like I'm trapped in this never-ending loop of negative thoughts, and it's suffocating me. I'm starting to realize that I need to find a way to silence this critical inner voice and start listening to my own inner wisdom. I'm not sure how to do that, but I know I need to start taking small steps towards letting go of this self-doubt and embracing my true potential.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're carrying a significant emotional burden, Andrew, and it's impacting your relationships and daily life in a major way. Can you help me understand what you think would happen if you were to start reframing your experiences with self-doubt and inadequacy as a natural part of the creative process, rather than a reflection of your worth as a person? How might that shift your perspective and relationship with cooking, and what would that look like for you?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I'm really struggling to think about reframing my experiences with self-doubt and inadequacy as a natural part of the creative process. It feels like a huge ask, and I'm not sure how to even begin to do that. Can you help me understand what that would look like in practice?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're already aware that this self-doubt is holding you back, but it's hard to take that first step towards making a change. Can you help me understand what's been driving your desire to break free from this pattern, and what you hope to achieve by reframing your experience with self-doubt?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I'm starting to realize that I've been carrying around this heavy burden of self-doubt and inadequacy for a long time, and it's exhausting. I'm tired of feeling like I'm stuck in this cycle of negativity and self-criticism. I want to break free from it and start living a more authentic and fulfilling life, where I can enjoy cooking and share my passion with others without being held back by these negative thoughts.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Can you tell me more about what you mean by self-doubt in the context of cooking? Is it more about being afraid of making mistakes, or is it a broader feeling of not being good enough as a chef?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>It's hard for me to separate the two, to be honest. I think it's a combination of both. When I'm cooking, I'm always worried about making mistakes, about not being good enough, about not meeting the expectations of others or even my own high standards. It's like, no matter what I do, I'm always going to fall short. And even when I do manage to create something good, I don't feel like it's good enough because I always think I could have done better. It's like, I'm constantly striving for perfection, but I'm never good enough.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It's fascinating to see how your self-doubt and fear of not being good enough has become deeply intertwined with your passion for cooking, Andrew. It's almost as if your fear of making mistakes has become a constant companion, always whispering in your ear, making it hard for you to fully enjoy the process of cooking. Can you help me understand what you think would happen if you were able to quiet that voice and focus on the joy and fulfillment that cooking brings you?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I feel like I've been stuck in this cycle of self-doubt and inadequacy for so long, and I don't know how to break free from it.

                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It seems like this fear of not being good enough has become a deeply ingrained part of your cooking experience, and it's understandable that it's affecting your enjoyment and confidence in the kitchen. Can you help me understand what you think would happen if you were to challenge this fear by focusing on the process of cooking, rather than the outcome? For example, what if you were to focus on the sensations, the textures, the smells, and the sounds of cooking, rather than worrying about how your dish turns out? How might that shift your perspective and relationship with cooking?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I don't know, it's hard for me to imagine a world where I'm not constantly worried about making mistakes or not being good enough. It feels like that's just how I'm wired. But I do know that I'm tired of feeling stuck and suffocated by this self-doubt. I want to break free from it and start living a more authentic and fulfilling life, where I can enjoy cooking and share my passion with others.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like this fear of not being good enough has become deeply intertwined with your sense of identity, and it's affecting not just your cooking but also your overall self-worth. Can you help me understand what you think would happen if you were to start reframing your identity away from being defined solely by your cooking, and towards being a multifaceted person with many passions and strengths? How might that shift your perspective and relationship with cooking, and what would that look like for you?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I'm starting to feel a sense of hopelessness and despair, like I'll never be able to break free from this cycle of self-doubt and inadequacy. It's like I'm stuck in this never-ending loop of negative thoughts, and it's suffocating me. I'm tired of feeling like I'm not good enough, and I don't know how to shake off this feeling. I feel like I'm constantly struggling to prove myself, and it's exhausting. I wish I could just be done with it all and move on, but I don't know how.</div>
