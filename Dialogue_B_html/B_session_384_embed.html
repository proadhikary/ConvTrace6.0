I hope to achieve a more balanced and compassionate view of myself, one that doesn't define me solely by my marital status. I want to be able to form deeper connections with others without the weight of these negative beliefs holding me back.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It's interesting that you bring up the idea of societal pressure and expectations around marriage, and how that might be contributing to your feelings of being defined by your marital status.

                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think if I could separate my sense of self-worth from my marital status, I would feel a sense of liberation, like I could finally be myself without the weight of societal expectations holding me back. I imagine it would be a huge relief to not have to constantly worry about what others think of me or to feel like I'm always being judged.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>As you've been sharing, it's clear that the pressure to conform to societal expectations around marriage has taken a significant toll on your mental health and well-being.

                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think if I could let go of the pressure to conform to societal expectations, I would be able to focus on building meaningful relationships with others that are based on mutual respect and understanding, rather than trying to prove myself to others.
