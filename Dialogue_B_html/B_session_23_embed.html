                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Hi Violet, it's nice to meet you. How are you feeling about being here today?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I'm feeling a bit mixed. Part of me is hopeful, but another part is skeptical if this will actually help.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It's great to hear that you're willing to explore this further, Violet. Can you tell me more about what specifically feels uncertain or skeptical about the idea of challenging and changing these negative thought patterns? Are there any past experiences or relationships that may be influencing your thoughts and feelings about seeking help?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I guess I'm worried that I'll just be told to think positive or be more optimistic, but that's not really the issue. I know intellectually that I should be grateful for what I have, but it's hard to shake off these negative thoughts. Sometimes I feel like I'm just going through the motions, and it's like I'm just pretending to be okay when I'm really not.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>I think it's really important to recognize that traditional advice can sometimes feel dismissive of our genuine feelings, and that's not helpful in the long run. It sounds like you're looking for a more nuanced understanding of your thoughts and feelings, and that's exactly what we're here to work towards. By exploring these negative thought patterns and the emotions behind them, we can start to develop a more personalized approach to managing your mental health. Can you tell me more about what you mean by going through the motions? How does it make you feel, and do you think it's related to any specific situations or events in your life?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah, it's like I'm just doing things because I'm supposed to, not because I'm actually enjoying them. When I'm surfing, for example, I'm thinking about all the things that could go wrong, and when I'm playing the piano, I'm worrying about not being good enough. It's like my mind is always focused on what could go wrong, and it's hard to shake off that feeling of impending doom. It feels like I'm just going through the motions, and I don't know how to break free from it.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It makes sense that you're feeling stuck in this pattern of negative thinking, and it's understandable that it's affecting your ability to fully engage in activities you used to enjoy. It's common for people to get caught in this cycle, and it's not uncommon for it to feel overwhelming. Can you tell me more about what you think would happen if you were able to break free from this pattern and start enjoying activities without the weight of negative thinking holding you back?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah, it sounds like you're saying that I'm kind of trapped in this cycle of negative thinking, and it's affecting my daily life. I guess if I could break free from it, I would be able to enjoy surfing and playing the piano without worrying about everything going wrong. I would be able to appreciate the small things and not let fear and anxiety dictate my actions.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>As you explore this idea of reframing, I want to acknowledge that it can be a challenging process, especially when it comes to habits of thinking that have been ingrained for a long time. It's like trying to break a pattern of behavior that has become automatic. But it's also an opportunity to develop a new way of thinking, one that can bring more freedom and joy into your life.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think it's really reassuring to hear that you acknowledge the difficulty of breaking free from negative thinking patterns. It's like, I know intellectually that I should be able to just shift my perspective, but it's hard to actually do it when it's been a part of my thought process for so long. I'm worried that even if I do start to challenge these thoughts, they'll just come back, and I'll be stuck in this cycle again.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're grappling with a sense of uncertainty and self-doubt, which is a very normal part of the process of trying to change ingrained thought patterns. It's understandable that you'd be worried about falling back into old habits, especially given how deeply entrenched they may feel. Can you tell me more about what you think would need to happen for you to feel more confident that you could maintain a more positive outlook over time?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah, I guess I'm worried that I'll just be told to think positive or be more optimistic, but that's not really the issue. I know intellectually that I should be grateful for what I have, but it's hard to shake off these negative thoughts. Sometimes I feel like I'm just going through the motions, and it's like I'm just pretending to be okay when I'm really not.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It's not uncommon for people to struggle with the idea of maintaining a positive outlook, especially when it feels like these negative thought patterns have been a part of your life for a long time. It's as if your mind has created a kind of comfort zone around these negative thoughts, and it's hard to imagine a different way of thinking. Can you think of any times in your life when you were able to break free from this comfort zone and create a new, more positive pattern? What was different about those experiences that made it possible for you to shift your perspective?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think about my experiences with surfing, when I first started, I was really nervous and anxious, but as I kept going, I started to feel more comfortable and confident. It's like, I was able to push through those initial fears and doubts and discover a new side of myself. Maybe that's what I need to do with my negative thoughts, find a way to push through them and discover a new way of thinking.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>As you reflect on your surfing experiences, it's interesting to consider how you've already developed skills to overcome initial fears and doubts. Building on that, it seems like you're recognizing that your mind has the capacity to adapt and change, even when it feels stuck. Can you tell me more about how you think you can apply those same principles to your current struggles with negative thinking, and what specific strategies or coping mechanisms you might use to help you shift your perspective?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think that's a really good point, and it makes sense that I would need to find a way to push through my negative thoughts and discover a new way of thinking. I'm not sure what specific strategies or coping mechanisms I would use, but I think it would involve being more mindful and present in my daily life, rather than getting caught up in those negative thought patterns. Maybe I could start by focusing on the present moment, and instead of worrying about what could go wrong, I could try to appreciate what I have and what I'm doing in the moment.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Let's build on your recognition of the importance of mindfulness and being present in the moment. It's interesting that you mention worries about the future or past - research has shown that our brains are wired to focus on what's not happening in the present moment, and that can lead to increased stress and anxiety. By cultivating mindfulness, we can learn to acknowledge those thoughts and emotions without getting caught up in them, and instead focus on what's happening in the present moment. What do you think about the idea of starting small, maybe just taking a few deep breaths before a task or activity to help bring your focus back to the present moment?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I like that idea of starting small, and I can see how taking a few deep breaths could help me focus on the present moment. It's funny, I never thought about how my brain is wired to focus on what's not happening in the present moment, but that makes total sense. I guess I just need to find ways to retrain my brain to stay present and appreciate what I have, rather than getting caught up in those negative thought patterns.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Noticing that you're recognizing the impact of negative thinking on your daily life, it's clear that you're taking a crucial step towards breaking free from those patterns. By acknowledging the present moment, you can start to shift your focus away from worries about the future or past, which can help reduce feelings of anxiety and increase your sense of control. Can you think of any specific situations or activities where you might be able to practice this mindfulness and presence in a more concrete way, perhaps as a way to start retraining your brain?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think I can start by incorporating mindfulness into my daily routine, like taking a few deep breaths before I start my shift at the bar or before I go surfing. Maybe I can also try to focus on the present moment while I'm playing the piano, instead of worrying about not being good enough. It's funny, I never thought about how my brain is wired to focus on what's not happening in the present moment, but that makes total sense. I guess I just need to find ways to retrain my brain to stay present and appreciate what I have, rather than getting caught up in those negative thought patterns.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It's common to feel overwhelmed when trying to make significant changes, like shifting your focus to the present moment. What's important to remember is that mindfulness is a practice that takes time and patience to develop. It's not about achieving a specific state or feeling a certain way, but rather about cultivating awareness and acceptance of the present moment.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think it's helpful to understand that I'm not alone in this struggle, and that it's normal to feel stuck in negative thought patterns. It's reassuring to know that I can start small and build up my mindfulness skills, rather than trying to make drastic changes all at once. I'm willing to give it a try and see how it goes.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It's great to see you're already recognizing the benefits of mindfulness and presence in your daily life. By acknowledging the comfort zone your mind has created around negative thoughts, you're taking the first step towards breaking free from those patterns. As you continue to practice mindfulness, remember that it's not about achieving a specific state or feeling a certain way, but rather about cultivating awareness and acceptance of the present moment.</div>

                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>As you're recognizing the value of mindfulness and presence in your daily life, it's common to feel a sense of excitement and hopefulness, but also to encounter some challenges along the way. Incorporating mindfulness into your daily routine can be a gradual process, and it's essential to be patient and kind to yourself as you work through it. By acknowledging that it's okay to take things one step at a time and that setbacks are a natural part of the process, you can cultivate a growth mindset and build resilience.</div>

By acknowledging that it's okay to start small and build up your skills gradually, you're taking a crucial step towards breaking free from negative thought patterns. I'd like to build on that by exploring how our minds tend to get caught up in negative thinking patterns, and how mindfulness can help us stay present and focused on the present moment. Can you imagine what it would be like to have a greater sense of calm and clarity, even in the midst of challenging situations, and how that might impact your relationships and overall sense of well-being?</div>
