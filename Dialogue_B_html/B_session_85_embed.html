                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Hi Rebecca, nice to meet you. How can I assist you today?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I've been feeling extremely anxious since I called in sick at work. I'm convinced that I'm going to lose my job and my license, even though my colleagues have tried to reassure me.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like this fear of losing your job and license is really tapping into that deep-seated concern about your sense of self and identity, and it's understandable that it's feeling very intense for you. Can you help me better understand what you think would happen if you were to lose your job and license? Is it a catastrophic event in your mind, or are there small parts of you that think you could adapt and find a new path forward?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think if I lost my job and license, it would be a complete disaster. I'd be unable to support myself, and my self-worth would be shattered. I'd be a failure in the eyes of my colleagues and clients. But, if I'm being honest with myself, I also worry about the stigma of being a veterinarian who couldn't even manage her own stress and anxiety.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It's clear that this fear is deeply personal and emotional for you, Rebecca, and it's not just about the practical consequences of losing your job and license. Can you help me understand what you think would happen if you were to lose your sense of professional identity as a veterinarian? How would that impact your daily life, and are there any specific aspects of your work or relationships that you think would be most affected?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>That's a great question. I think if I lost my professional identity as a veterinarian, I would struggle to find a new sense of purpose and meaning. I've always defined myself through my work, and not having that would leave a huge void. I'm also worried that I wouldn't be able to connect with others on the same level, since my work is such a big part of who I am.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It's not surprising that you're feeling a sense of loss and uncertainty about this potential change, given how deeply your sense of identity and purpose are tied to your work as a veterinarian. Can you help me understand what aspects of your work bring you a sense of fulfillment and purpose, and how you think you might be able to hold onto those aspects if you were to transition out of your current role?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think my sense of fulfillment and purpose comes from helping animals and their owners. I love the feeling of making a difference in their lives and being able to provide quality care. If I were to transition out of my current role, I could potentially find a way to continue doing this, perhaps through volunteering or working in a different capacity.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It's fascinating to see how your passion for helping animals and their owners has not only brought you joy but also a sense of purpose and fulfillment. As you mentioned, it's not just about the act of healing, but also the relationships you build with clients, which highlights the importance of connection and empathy in your work. Can you tell me more about how you think you could adapt this aspect of your work to a new context, perhaps even outside of a traditional veterinary setting, where you could still use your skills to make a positive impact and nurture meaningful relationships?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think about it, and I realize that I've been so focused on the what-ifs that I haven't really thought about the what-elses. If I lost my job and license, I could try to find a new way to help animals and their owners, like volunteering or working in a different capacity. It's not about losing my identity as a veterinarian, but about finding a new way to express my passion and purpose.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It's amazing to see you recognizing that your identity as a veterinarian is not solely defined by your current role. By acknowledging this, you're opening up possibilities for a new sense of purpose and fulfillment. Can you tell me more about what sparks your excitement about exploring these new opportunities, and what specific aspects of your current role you think you could carry over into a new context?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think it's really interesting that you're pointing out that my identity as a veterinarian isn't solely defined by my current role. It's making me realize that I have more control over my life and my sense of purpose than I initially thought. I'm excited to explore these new opportunities and find a way to continue making a difference in the lives of animals and their owners. I'm starting to feel a sense of hope and optimism about the future, rather than just focusing on the negative consequences of losing my job and license.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>As you've been exploring these new possibilities, it's interesting that you're noticing a sense of freedom and empowerment emerging. This is a common experience for people who are willing to challenge their assumptions and consider new paths forward. Can you tell me more about what this newfound sense of freedom feels like, and how you think it might impact your daily life and relationships?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think what's exciting is that I'm starting to realize that I have more control over my life and my sense of purpose than I initially thought. It's like a weight has been lifted off my shoulders, and I'm no longer stuck in this cycle of negative thinking and fear. I'm starting to see that there are possibilities beyond my current role as a veterinarian, and that's giving me a sense of hope and optimism about the future. It's funny, because I never thought I'd be the type of person who would be open to change, but now I'm actually looking forward to exploring these new opportunities and finding a way to continue making a difference in the lives of animals and their owners.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>As you continue to explore these new possibilities, I'm curious to know, what are some of the specific emotions or thoughts that arise when you think about leaving your current role as a veterinarian, and how do you plan to address those emotions or thoughts as you move forward?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think I've been so caught up in the fear of losing my job and license that I haven't really stopped to consider what I would gain by leaving my current role.

I'm excited to explore these new opportunities and find a way to continue making a difference in the lives of animals and their owners. I'm starting to feel a sense of hope and optimism about the future, rather than just focusing on the negative consequences of losing my job and license.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're recognizing that your sense of purpose and fulfillment is not solely tied to your role as a veterinarian, but also to the values and passions that drive your work. This awareness can be a powerful liberating force, allowing you to reimagine what's possible beyond your current role. How do you think this newfound sense of freedom and empowerment might affect your relationships with your colleagues, clients, and even yourself?</div>

At the same time, it's exciting to consider how this newfound awareness of your values and passions might allow you to bring a fresh perspective and energy to your relationships with your pets, and potentially even to your own sense of purpose and fulfillment. How do you think you might need to adapt your approach to caring for your animals, and what specific skills or strengths do you think you could bring to this new context?</div>
