                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Hi Gina, it's nice to meet you. How are you feeling today?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I'm feeling a bit overwhelmed, to be honest. The incident during the rehearsal has really taken a toll on me, and I can't seem to shake off these feelings of inadequacy.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>As you're processing this experience, it's clear that your sense of identity as a dancer is closely tied to your self-worth. Can you help me understand what specific thoughts or beliefs are running through your mind when you think about yourself as a dancer, and how has this incident changed those thoughts or beliefs for you?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>That's a really insightful question. When I think about myself as a dancer, I often feel like I'm not good enough, that I'm just a mistake waiting to happen. The incident has amplified those thoughts, making me feel like I'm completely incompetent and that my career is over. I find myself replaying the incident in my head, wondering what I could have done differently to prevent it, and beating myself up over it.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like reliving the incident in your head has become a way for you to try to make sense of what happened and perhaps even find a sense of control over the situation, but at the same time, it's also perpetuating this cycle of self-criticism and negative self-talk. Can you help me understand what specific thoughts or images come up for you when you're replaying the incident, and how do you think that might be linked to your feelings of not being good enough as a dancer?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah, I think that's accurate. When I replay the incident in my head, I see myself getting knocked down and I think about how I should have avoided the other dancer or reacted differently. I also think about how I'm going to be perceived by my colleagues and how this might affect my reputation as a dancer. I feel like I'm constantly replaying this scenario, trying to figure out what I could have done differently, and it's like I'm stuck in this loop.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It's interesting to see how replaying the incident has become a way for you to process and make sense of what happened, while also acknowledging the toll it's taking on your mental well-being. Can you tell me more about what you think is driving this need to replay the incident in your mind, and how you think it's impacting your daily life and relationships as a dancer?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah, I think that's accurate. When I replay the incident in my head, I see myself getting knocked down and I think about how I should have avoided the other dancer or reacted differently. I also think about how I'm going to be perceived by my colleagues and how this might affect my reputation as a dancer. I feel like I'm constantly replaying this scenario, trying to figure out what I could have done differently, and it's like I'm stuck in this loop.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It's not uncommon for dancers to struggle with feelings of self-doubt and inadequacy, especially when they've invested so much of themselves into their craft. The desire for control and perfection can be a powerful force, and it's interesting that you mention the incident has shaken your foundation as a dancer. Can you help me understand how you think this experience has impacted your sense of identity as a dancer, and whether you feel like you're losing a part of yourself in the process?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think that's a really good question. When the incident happened, I felt like I was no longer the same dancer I used to be. I felt like I'd lost my confidence and my sense of self as a dancer. I started to question whether I was cut out for this profession and whether I was just fooling myself all along. The more I replay the incident in my head, the more I feel like I'm losing myself as a dancer. I'm starting to wonder if I'm just a one-hit wonder, if I only got lucky and this was just a fluke. It's like I'm stuck in this limbo, trying to figure out who I am as a dancer now that this incident has happened.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It's as if the incident has created a sense of disconnection between your sense of self as a dancer and your current experiences, leaving you feeling uncertain and unclear about your identity as a performer. Many dancers have to face setbacks and injuries, and it's not uncommon for them to wonder if they're still good enough or if they've reached the end of their career. Can you help me explore this further by imagining a scenario where you've fully processed the incident and moved forward as a dancer, what would that look like for you?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>That's a really helpful exercise. If I were to fully process the incident and move forward as a dancer, I think I would have to let go of the guilt and shame I'm carrying around. I would need to reframe my thoughts about the incident and recognize that it was an unfortunate accident, rather than a reflection of my worth as a dancer. I would need to focus on my strengths and the skills I've developed as a dancer, rather than dwelling on what went wrong. I would also need to communicate openly with my colleagues and team about what happened and work together to prevent similar incidents in the future. And finally, I would need to practice self-compassion and remind myself that setbacks are a natural part of the journey, and that I am capable of growing and learning from my mistakes.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like reframing the incident and recognizing your strengths as a dancer are essential steps in reclaiming your sense of identity and confidence. The concept of psychological flexibility is also valuable to consider, as it allows us to acknowledge and process our emotions without getting stuck in them. In our next session, I'd like to explore this concept further and help you develop strategies for cultivating greater flexibility in your thinking and emotions.</div>

                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It's fascinating that you're recognizing the emotional toll of the incident on your sense of identity and purpose as a dancer. It's common for traumatic experiences to leave us feeling lost and uncertain about how to move forward. Rumination, as we discussed, can be a significant obstacle to healing, but it's great that you're taking the first steps towards acknowledging and understanding its impact on your mental health.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I can see how replaying the incident in my head has become a way for me to process and make sense of what happened, but it's also clear that it's not serving me well. I think I need to find a way to let go of the guilt and shame I'm carrying around and focus on my strengths as a dancer. I'd like to work on reframing my thoughts about the incident and recognize that it was an unfortunate accident, rather than a reflection of my worth as a dancer. I also want to practice self-compassion and remind myself that setbacks are a natural part of the journey, and that I am capable of growing and learning from my mistakes.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>As you've shared, it's clear that the incident has not only affected your confidence as a dancer but also your sense of self-worth. It's understandable that you might feel a strong connection between your identity as a dancer and your overall sense of self. Can you help me understand how you think this connection has influenced your thoughts and feelings about your ability to move forward as a dancer, and what steps you think you might need to take to reconcile these two aspects of your identity?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah, I think that's accurate. I've been replaying the incident in my head because I'm still trying to make sense of what happened and figure out how I can prevent it from happening again. But at the same time, I know that reliving the incident is not a healthy way for me to process my emotions, and it's actually making me feel worse about myself as a dancer. I think I need to find a way to let go of the guilt and shame I'm carrying around and focus on my strengths as a dancer, rather than dwelling on what went wrong. I'd like to work on reframing my thoughts about the incident and recognize that it was an unfortunate accident, rather than a reflection of my worth as a dancer.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're recognizing the importance of reframing your thoughts about the incident and focusing on your strengths as a dancer. I'd like to build on that by sharing that it's common for people to hold onto negative thoughts and emotions as a way of coping with the uncertainty and loss of control that can come with a traumatic experience. But I also want to emphasize that it's not only possible but also beneficial to find a way to integrate the incident into your identity as a dancer, rather than letting it define you. By doing so, you might be able to not only move forward as a dancer but also find a sense of post-traumatic growth and increased resilience.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I'm glad we're having this conversation, and I appreciate your insight into how I've been replaying the incident in my head. I think I've been trying to make sense of it and figure out how I can prevent it from happening again, but at the same time, I know that reliving the incident is not a healthy way for me to process my emotions.

                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like reframing your thoughts about the incident and focusing on your strengths as a dancer is a crucial step in reclaiming your sense of identity and confidence. I'd like to add that reframing doesn't have to mean erasing the experience or minimizing its impact, but rather finding a way to integrate it into your story as a dancer. By doing so, you can begin to shift the focus from what went wrong to what you've learned and grown from, and start to rebuild your sense of identity and confidence. How do you think you might be able to start incorporating this reframing into your daily life and performance?</div>

                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It's fascinating to see how our conversation has illuminated the intricate web of thoughts, emotions, and experiences that have contributed to your sense of identity as a dancer. It's clear that the incident has shaken your confidence and left you questioning your abilities. I'd like to explore this further by highlighting that it's common for dancers to experience a sense of disconnection from their bodies and performances after a traumatic event. This disconnect can lead to feelings of fragmentation and uncertainty about one's identity and purpose as a performer. Can you help me understand how you think this disconnection has affected your daily life and relationships as a dancer, and what you envision as the first steps towards reconnecting with your body and performance?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think that's a great point, and I can definitely see how replaying the incident in my head has become a way for me to process and make sense of what happened. At the same time, I know that reliving the incident is not a healthy way for me to process my emotions, and it's actually making me feel worse about myself as a dancer.

                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like this experience has had a profound impact on your sense of identity and purpose as a dancer, and you're struggling to reconcile the dancer you once were with the dancer you feel like you've become now. Can you help me understand how you think your relationship with your body has changed since the incident, and what you think would need to shift in order for you to feel like you're back in touch with your physical self and your performances?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think it's been really challenging for me to connect with my body and my performances since the incident. I feel like I'm constantly replaying the incident in my head, trying to make sense of what happened and figure out how I can prevent it from happening again. But at the same time, I know that reliving the incident is not a healthy way for me to process my emotions, and it's actually making me feel worse about myself as a dancer.

                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It's clear that the incident has had a profound impact on your sense of identity and purpose as a dancer, and it's not surprising that you're struggling to reconnect with your body and performances. Rumination can be a powerful force, and it's interesting to explore how it's become a coping mechanism for you. By acknowledging the role that rumination has played in your experience, you may be able to start to identify the underlying emotions and needs that are driving it, and begin to develop more constructive ways of processing your emotions and moving towards a sense of healing and closure.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think that's a really insightful question.

                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like the incident has not only shaken your confidence as a dancer but also created a sense of disconnection from your body and performances. I'd like to explore this further by asking, what do you think would happen if you were to approach your dancing with a sense of curiosity and experimentation, rather than trying to recreate the past or meet some idealized standard of performance? How might that shift your relationship with your body and your dancing identity?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think that's a really interesting question. If I were to approach my dancing with a sense of curiosity and experimentation, I think I would feel more open to learning and growth as a dancer. I would be more willing to take risks and try new things, rather than getting stuck in my old ways of thinking and feeling. I think I would also feel more connected to my body and my performances, rather than just going through the motions.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>As you continue to explore this new awareness of the impact of the incident on your sense of identity and purpose as a dancer, I want to acknowledge that it's a significant step towards healing and growth. It's understandable that this awareness may have brought up a sense of uncertainty about how to move forward and integrate this new understanding into your daily life and performances. Can you help me understand what you think would be the most important thing for you to focus on in the coming weeks, and what small steps you might take to start rebuilding your confidence and connection to your body and dancing?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think the most important thing for me to focus on is to let go of the guilt and shame I'm carrying around and focus on my strengths as a dancer, rather than dwelling on what went wrong.

Can you help me understand what specific aspects of your dancing identity you feel have been impacted, and how you think you might begin to re-integrate those aspects into your sense of self and creative expression?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>That's a really insightful question.

I feel like I'm just doing what I'm supposed to do, rather than truly enjoying it or feeling connected to it. I also feel like I'm struggling to connect with my fellow dancers and the audience, like I'm just a body going through the motions, rather than a true artist.</div>

It's common for dancers to experience a sense of disconnection from their physical self and creative expression after a traumatic event. In our next session, I'd like to explore the concept of re-framing and how you can use this technique to shift your focus away from what went wrong and towards what you've learned and grown from.
