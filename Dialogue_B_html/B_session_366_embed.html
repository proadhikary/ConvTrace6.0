                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Hi Derek, I'm glad you decided to reach out. Can you tell me what brings you in today?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I've been feeling really stressed and overwhelmed about not spending every moment preparing for college. I feel guilty when I take breaks, and it's getting exhausting.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It's completely normal to feel this way when you're under a lot of pressure to perform, and it's great that you're recognizing the impact it's having on your mental well-being. Can you help me understand what you think will happen if you don't spend every waking moment preparing for college? What are some of the fears or worries that are driving this sense of urgency for you?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>That's a great question, counselor. I think if I don't spend every moment preparing for college, I'll fall behind and not be able to handle the academic demands of the University of Michigan. I'm worried that I won't be able to keep up with the coursework and will end up failing or having to take a semester off. This thought has been really stressing me out and making me feel guilty for taking breaks or not studying enough.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It's understandable that you're feeling this way, given the high standards you've set for yourself and the pressure to perform. Can you tell me more about what you think will happen if you don't meet these expectations? What are you afraid of, and is there anything specific that's driving this need for perfection?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think if I don't meet these expectations, I'll be a disappointment to my parents and siblings, and they'll lose faith in me. I'm also afraid that I won't be able to compete with my peers who are also heading to top-notch universities. This fear is making me feel like I need to be perfect, and if I'm not, I'll be failing in some way.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It's not uncommon for students to feel this pressure to perform, especially when they have supportive families that expect a lot from them. Can you tell me more about what you think your parents' expectations are of you, and how do you feel like you're meeting those expectations so far?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah, my parents have always been really supportive and encouraging, but lately, they've been asking me more about my study habits and grades, and it's making me feel like they're expecting me to get perfect grades. They're always talking about how important it is to excel in college, and it's like they're putting a lot of pressure on me to do well. When I don't meet their expectations, it feels like they're disappointed in me, and that's what's really stressing me out.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It's interesting that you mention feeling like you're losing your sense of self in an attempt to meet others' expectations. Can you help me understand what you mean by that? How do you think your sense of self-worth is tied to your academic performance, and what do you hope to achieve by meeting your parents' expectations?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think my sense of self-worth is deeply tied to my academic performance, especially since my parents have always emphasized the importance of achieving academic success. I feel like if I don't meet their expectations, I'm not good enough or smart enough, and that thought is really scary for me. I hope to achieve a sense of validation and approval from my parents by meeting their expectations, but at the same time, I know that can't be the only way I measure my worth as a person.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It's interesting that you mention feeling like you're losing your sense of self in an attempt to meet others' expectations. I want to acknowledge that it's common for people, especially during significant life transitions like college, to feel pressure to conform to certain standards or expectations. Can you help me better understand what you think would happen if you were to let go of some of this pressure and focus more on your own values and goals, rather than trying to meet others' expectations?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>That's a really good question, counselor. I think if I were to let go of some of this pressure and focus more on my own values and goals, I would feel more authentic and genuine in my pursuits. I would be able to focus on what truly matters to me, rather than trying to meet others' expectations. I think this would also help me to develop a stronger sense of self-worth, as I would be able to rely on my own strengths and abilities, rather than constantly seeking validation from others.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>As you start to imagine what it would be like to live in alignment with your values and goals, I want to acknowledge that this process can be complex and may involve some discomfort, especially when it comes to navigating the expectations of others. Can you tell me more about what you think would be the most challenging part of making this shift, and how you think you might go about addressing those challenges?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think the most challenging part of making this shift would be letting go of the feeling of being a disappointment to my parents if I don't meet their expectations. I'm worried that they'll be really upset with me and that it will affect our relationship. I'm also concerned about not being able to live up to my own expectations of being a high-achieving student. I'm not sure how to balance my own goals with my parents' expectations and still feel like I'm making progress towards my own values and goals.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're carrying a significant amount of emotional weight in attempting to meet everyone's expectations, and that's taking a toll on your mental well-being. Can you help me understand what you think would happen if you were to take a step back and prioritize your own values and goals, even if that means having a difficult conversation with your parents about their expectations?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>That's a really good question, counselor. I think taking a step back and prioritizing my own values and goals would allow me to focus on what truly matters to me, rather than constantly seeking validation from others. I would be able to develop a stronger sense of self-worth, as I would be able to rely on my own strengths and abilities, rather than constantly seeking approval from my parents.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>As you start to imagine what it would be like to make decisions that align with your own values and goals, rather than trying to meet others' expectations, it's natural to feel uncertain about how others might react. It's almost as if you're carrying around a weight of responsibility to make sure everyone else is happy, on top of trying to navigate your own path. Can you help me understand what you think would happen if you were to start letting go of that weight and focusing more on your own needs and desires?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think that would be a huge relief, counselor. It's like I would be releasing all this pressure and stress that I've been carrying around for so long. I would be able to focus on what truly matters to me, rather than constantly trying to meet others' expectations. I would be able to develop a stronger sense of self-worth, as I would be able to rely on my own strengths and abilities, rather than constantly seeking validation from others.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>As you start to imagine what it would be like to take small steps towards prioritizing your own values and goals, I want to acknowledge that it's normal to feel uncertain and worried about how others might react, especially when it comes to your parents. It's also important to recognize that you can't control how others respond, but you can control how you choose to approach the situation. What do you think would be the most empowering thing for you to do in this moment, even if it's just taking a small step towards aligning with your own values and goals?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>That's a really good question, counselor. I think the most empowering thing for me to do in this moment would be to have a conversation with my parents about their expectations and how they're affecting my mental well-being. I've been avoiding this conversation because I'm afraid of their reaction, but I think it's essential for me to address these feelings and boundaries. I would like to approach this conversation with empathy and understanding, acknowledging their concerns while also expressing my own needs and desires. I hope that by being open and honest, we can find a way to compromise and work together towards a solution that respects both our boundaries.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>I can sense that you're already taking a brave step by acknowledging the pressure you're facing and considering how it's impacting your mental well-being. It's great that you're thinking about how to prioritize your own values and goals, and I encourage you to keep exploring that. Can you tell me more about what you hope to achieve by having this conversation with your parents? What kind of support or understanding are you hoping to get from them, and what are you willing to share with them about your own needs and desires?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think having this conversation with my parents will help me to clear the air and address the underlying issues that are causing me so much stress and anxiety. I hope that by being open and honest, we can find a way to compromise and work together towards a solution that respects both our boundaries. I'm also hoping that my parents will be more understanding and supportive, and that we can find a way to prioritize my mental well-being alongside their expectations.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're already taking a big step by acknowledging the pressure you're facing and considering how it's impacting your mental well-being. I want to acknowledge that it can be really challenging to have tough conversations with parents, especially when you're trying to assert your own needs and boundaries. Can you help me understand what you think would be the most important thing for you to get out of this conversation with your parents, and how you might prioritize your own well-being and needs within that conversation?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think the most important thing for me to get out of this conversation with my parents is to have them acknowledge and understand my feelings and needs. I want them to know that I'm not just trying to avoid their expectations, but I'm actually trying to prioritize my own well-being and mental health. I hope that by being open and honest, we can find a way to compromise and work together towards a solution that respects both our boundaries. I also hope that my parents will be more supportive and understanding, and that we can find a way to prioritize my mental well-being alongside their expectations.</div>

Can you help me understand what you think would be the most important thing for you to get out of this conversation, and how you might prioritize your own well-being and needs within that conversation? Additionally, I want to remind you that setting boundaries and prioritizing your own needs is a process and it's okay to take it one step at a time. You don't have to have all the answers right now, and it's okay to make mistakes along the way.</div>

As you think about having this conversation with your parents, it might be helpful to remember that setting boundaries and prioritizing your own needs is a process, and it's okay to take it one step at a time. What are some small, manageable steps you could take in the coming week to start exploring what you need and want in this situation, and how you might communicate that to your parents?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think one small step I could take is to write down my thoughts and feelings about this conversation and what I hope to achieve from it. I could also start thinking about specific examples of how my parents' expectations have affected me in the past, and how I would like them to support me differently in the future. Additionally, I might consider having a conversation with a trusted friend or family member about my concerns and getting their perspective on how to approach the conversation with my parents.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It's great to see you're already taking steps towards prioritizing your own needs and boundaries. By acknowledging the pressure you're facing and considering how it's impacting your mental well-being, you're already taking a huge step towards creating positive change. Now, let's break down this process further and identify some specific strategies that work best for you. Can you tell me more about what you think would be most helpful for you to focus on in this conversation with your parents, and how you might go about communicating your needs and boundaries in a way that feels authentic and assertive to you?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>That's a great question, counselor. I think what would be most helpful for me to focus on in this conversation with my parents is to express my feelings and needs in a clear and respectful manner. I would like to start by acknowledging their concerns and then explaining how their expectations have been affecting me. I think it's essential to use I statements to describe how I'm feeling, rather than accusing them of being overly critical or demanding. For example, I could say, I feel overwhelmed and stressed when you constantly ask me about my grades and study habits. I feel like I'm not doing enough to meet your expectations, and that's causing me a lot of anxiety. By expressing my feelings and needs in this way, I hope to help my parents understand where I'm coming from and find a way to compromise that respects both our boundaries.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're already taking a thoughtful approach to considering how you can express your needs and boundaries to your parents. Can you help me understand what you think would be the most challenging part of having this conversation with them, and how you might prepare yourself to address those challenges in a way that feels authentic and empowering to you?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think what would be most challenging for me is actually having the conversation with my parents. I'm worried that they might not understand my perspective or that they'll be disappointed or upset with me for setting boundaries. I'm also concerned that I might not be able to express myself clearly or assertively, which could lead to misunderstandings or conflicts.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>As you've shared, you're already taking a thoughtful approach to considering how you can express your needs and boundaries to your parents. It's normal to feel anxious or uncertain about having this conversation, especially given the significant emotional weight you've described. One strategy that might be helpful is to practice assertive communication techniques, such as maintaining eye contact, speaking clearly and confidently, and being specific about your needs and boundaries. Would you be open to exploring some strategies like this further, or is there another approach that you think might work better for you?</div>

I think I need to start by acknowledging my feelings and needs rather than just trying to meet my parents' expectations. I've been putting their needs above my own, and that's been causing me a lot of stress and anxiety. I think I need to start prioritizing my own well-being and making sure I'm taking care of myself. Maybe I could start by setting small boundaries, like setting aside time each day to do something I enjoy or taking a break when I need to. I also need to work on communicating my needs and boundaries more effectively, like using I statements and being clear and specific about what I need.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're recognizing the importance of prioritizing your own needs and setting boundaries with your parents.
