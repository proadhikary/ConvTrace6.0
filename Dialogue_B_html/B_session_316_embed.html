                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Hello Wendy, thank you for coming in today. How can I assist you?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Hi, thank you for seeing me. I've been struggling with self-doubt and feelings of inadequacy, especially when it comes to my computer-building skills. It's been really affecting my motivation and confidence.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It's common to experience a sense of self-doubt when taking on a new challenge, and it sounds like computer-building is definitely pushing you out of your comfort zone. Can you help me understand what you're thinking when you're working on a project and you start to feel like you're not good enough? Are there any specific thoughts or internal conversations that stand out to you as being particularly critical or self-doubting?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah, I think what happens is that I start to think about all the things that could go wrong, like if someone points out a mistake or if I damage something. Then I start to feel like I'm not capable of doing it, and that I shouldn't even be trying. It's like my mind is telling me that I'm not good enough, and that I'll never be good enough.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It's interesting that you notice these negative thoughts patterns, and it's not uncommon for people to get stuck in this cycle of self-doubt. Can you help me understand what you think would happen if you were to challenge these negative thoughts and replace them with more balanced ones? For example, would you be more likely to take risks and try new things, or would you still feel held back by these doubts?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>That's a good question. I think if I were to challenge these negative thoughts, I might feel more confident and willing to take risks. Maybe I would be more open to learning and improving, and less focused on the potential downsides. But at the same time, I'm not sure if I'm really ready to let go of those doubts completely, because they've become such a habit for me. It's hard to imagine not thinking that way.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It's fascinating to see how our brains can get stuck in these patterns, and it's great that you're acknowledging the comfort you've become accustomed to, even if it's holding you back. Can you help me understand what you think would happen if you were to start practicing mindfulness and acknowledging these self-doubting thoughts, but not necessarily believing them or giving in to them? How might that affect your relationship with computer-building and your sense of self?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>That's a really good point, and I think I've been so focused on trying to eliminate these negative thoughts that I haven't considered just acknowledging them and moving forward. I can see how that could be a more effective way to deal with them, especially since they're not necessarily based in reality. But at the same time, it's hard for me to imagine not trying to push those thoughts away, because that's just what I've always done. Maybe I need to try a different approach and see how it goes.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It's interesting that you're recognizing the impact of these negative thought patterns on your daily life, and acknowledging the role that avoidance plays in maintaining them. Can you help me understand what you think would happen if you were to start to develop a more accepting and gentle relationship with your self-doubting thoughts, rather than trying to push them away or eliminate them entirely? How might that affect your overall sense of well-being and your approach to computer-building?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think that's a really good approach, acknowledging and accepting my thoughts instead of trying to change them or push them away. It's almost like I've been in this constant battle with myself, trying to suppress these negative thoughts and feelings of inadequacy, and it's been exhausting. If I could learn to accept and observe them without judgment, I think it would be a huge relief. And who knows, maybe it would even allow me to develop a more realistic sense of my abilities and what I'm capable of.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It's fascinating to see how acknowledging and accepting your self-doubting thoughts can feel like a turning point for you. The idea that you don't have to be at war with your own mind is a powerful one. Can you help me understand what you think would be the first step in starting to develop this more accepting relationship with your self-doubting thoughts, and how you might start to practice that in your daily life, especially when you're working on computer-building projects?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think the first step would be to start acknowledging and recognizing when I'm having these negative thoughts, like when I'm thinking I'm not good enough or I'm going to mess this up. Maybe I can take a step back and say to myself okay, I'm having this thought, but it's not necessarily true. And then try to reframe it in a more positive or realistic light. Like instead of I'm not good enough, I could say I'm doing my best and I'm learning as I go. That way I'm not trying to eliminate the thought, but I'm also not giving in to it either.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>I love how you're recognizing the importance of acknowledging and accepting your self-doubting thoughts, and how that could allow you to develop a more realistic sense of your abilities. It's interesting that you mention reframing negative thoughts, which is a great technique to become more aware of our inner dialogue. Can you help me understand what might be holding you back from implementing this strategy in your daily life, and what small steps you could take to start practicing it in a way that feels manageable and sustainable for you?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I can see how reframing negative thoughts could be a helpful strategy, but I'm not sure if I can just flip a switch and start doing it. It feels like a big change, and I'm worried that I'll just go back to my old patterns of thinking. Maybe I could start small, like when I'm doing a simple task, like tightening a screw, and catch myself thinking I'm not good enough and then reframe it to I'm doing my best and I'm learning as I go. That way, I can build up my skills and confidence gradually, rather than trying to make a big change all at once.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're already thinking ahead about how to incorporate this strategy into your daily life, which is great. I want to acknowledge that it can be scary to make changes, especially when it comes to our thought patterns. It's natural to worry about slipping back into old habits. But what if, instead of seeing reframing as a one-time achievement, you approach it as a process that takes time and practice? How might you be able to incorporate self-compassion and understanding into your experience, allowing yourself to learn and adapt at your own pace?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think what holds me back from implementing this strategy is that it feels like I'm constantly battling with myself, and I'm not sure if I'm ready to accept that I'll always have these negative thoughts. Maybe I need to focus on being more self-compassionate and understanding, and remind myself that it's okay to have these thoughts, even if they're not necessarily true.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It's interesting that you mention self-compassion, because research has shown that treating ourselves with kindness and understanding can actually help to reduce negative thought patterns and increase self-acceptance. In fact, one study found that self-compassion was a key factor in predicting long-term changes in negative thinking patterns. Would you like to explore some strategies for practicing self-compassion in your daily life, especially when you're feeling anxious or self-doubting?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think it's really helpful to acknowledge that it's okay to have these negative thoughts, and that I don't have to be perfect all the time. It's almost like I've been putting too much pressure on myself, trying to be this perfect person, and that's led to these feelings of inadequacy and self-doubt. If I can learn to be more self-compassionate and understanding, maybe I can start to let go of these expectations and just focus on being the best version of myself, flaws and all.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>I love how you're recognizing the importance of self-compassion and accepting your imperfections. It's really common for people to struggle with letting go of perfectionism and expecting too much from themselves. In fact, research has shown that when we're kind and understanding towards ourselves, even in our flaws and mistakes, it can actually help to reduce anxiety and depression. Would you like to explore some specific strategies for practicing self-compassion, such as writing down things you're grateful for each day or taking a few deep breaths before responding to a difficult situation?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think what's really holding me back from implementing this self-compassion strategy is the fear of being too soft or weak. I've always been someone who prides myself on being tough and resilient, and the idea of being kind to myself feels almost like a betrayal of that. But at the same time, I can see how it could be really beneficial, especially when it comes to reducing my self-doubt and anxiety. Maybe I just need to focus on being kind to myself, even if it feels awkward or uncomfortable at first.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It's interesting that you bring up the idea of being weak or vulnerable by being kind to yourself, because often times self-compassion is stigmatized as being self-indulgent or lazy. Can you help me understand what you think would happen if you were to reframe self-compassion as an act of self-care, rather than a sign of weakness? How might that change your relationship with yourself and your ability to practice self-compassion in daily life?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think I've been so focused on trying to eliminate my self-doubt and negative thoughts that I haven't considered the possibility of redefining what it means to be strong and resilient. Maybe being kind to myself and acknowledging my imperfections is actually a sign of strength, not weakness. If I can learn to view self-compassion as an act of self-care, rather than a sign of weakness, I think it would be incredibly liberating. It would allow me to focus on being the best version of myself, rather than trying to be perfect all the time. And who knows, maybe it would even allow me to develop a more realistic sense of my abilities and what I'm capable of.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're recognizing the importance of reframing self-compassion as a sign of strength, rather than weakness. Can you help me understand what you think would happen if you were to start practicing self-compassion as a form of self-care, and how that might impact your relationships with others? Additionally, are there any specific situations or people in your life where you think you might need to reframe your thinking around self-compassion in order to cultivate a more positive and supportive environment?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think I'm starting to see that self-compassion isn't about being weak or vulnerable, but rather about being strong and resilient in a different way. It's about acknowledging that I'm human and that it's okay to make mistakes.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>I love how you're exploring the idea of reframing self-compassion as a sign of strength, rather than weakness. It's interesting to consider how this shift in perspective could not only impact your relationship with yourself but also influence your interactions with others. Can you help me understand what you think would happen if you were to start practicing self-compassion as a form of self-care, and how that might affect your relationships with others? For instance, do you think your friends and family would be more likely to open up and be vulnerable with you if they saw you practicing self-compassion with yourself?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think it's really interesting to explore how reframing self-compassion as a sign of strength could affect my relationships with others. I can see how, if I'm more comfortable with being kind and understanding towards myself, I might be more likely to create a safe and supportive environment for others to do the same. Maybe my friends and family would feel more comfortable opening up and being vulnerable with me if they saw me practicing self-compassion with myself.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>As you continue to explore this new perspective on self-compassion, I'm curious to know what you think would be the most significant challenge for you in adopting this mindset, and how you might be able to overcome that challenge.</div>

                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think I've made some progress in recognizing the importance of self-compassion and reframing my negative thoughts, but I still struggle with acknowledging and accepting my imperfections.
