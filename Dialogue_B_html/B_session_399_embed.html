                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Hi, Austin. Thanks for coming in today. How are you feeling?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I'm feeling a bit nervous, but I'm good. Thanks for asking. I wanted to talk about how I've been struggling with negative self-labeling, especially when I make mistakes. It's really affecting my confidence and keeping me from enjoying activities I used to love, like playing softball.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Can you help me understand what you think would happen if you were to let go of those negative self-labels and just focus on having fun and learning from your mistakes?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>That's a really good question. To be honest, I'm not sure what would happen if I didn't label myself as a failure when I make mistakes. Maybe I would be more willing to take risks and try new things, which could help me improve my skills and enjoy activities more. But at the same time, I'm afraid that if I don't label myself as a failure, I'll think I'm not trying hard enough or that I'm just pretending to be confident. It's like, I don't know, I feel like I need to balance being confident with being realistic about my abilities.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're carrying a heavy burden of self-criticism, and that's making it tough for you to take risks and enjoy the process of learning and growing. Can you tell me more about what you think would happen if you were to let go of those negative self-labels and just focus on making progress, rather than worrying about being perfect?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>That makes sense. I think if I focused on making progress and learning from my mistakes, I would be more open to trying new things and taking risks, which would help me improve my skills and build confidence. But, I'm still worried that I'll be perceived as incompetent or that others will think I'm not trying hard enough.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It's interesting that you're concerned about what others might think, and it's almost as if you're carrying a heavy weight of expectation on your shoulders. Can you help me understand where this fear of being perceived as incompetent or lazy comes from? Is it something that's been going on for a while, or is it a more recent development?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>That's a great point. I think this fear of being perceived as incompetent or lazy comes from my childhood. My parents were always very critical of me, especially when I made mistakes. They would constantly remind me that I needed to do better and that I was not good enough. It's like, I feel like I've been carrying this weight of expectation around with me for so long that it's hard for me to let go of the fear of being judged or perceived as incompetent.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It's interesting to me that you're still carrying around this sense of self-doubt and fear of being perceived as incompetent, even though you're now aware of how it's affecting your life and relationships. Can you tell me more about what you think would happen if you were able to let go of this fear and start focusing on your strengths and accomplishments, rather than dwelling on your parents' criticism?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>That's a really good question. I think if I were able to let go of this fear and start focusing on my strengths and accomplishments, I would be more confident in my abilities and more willing to take risks. I would also be able to build more meaningful relationships with others, because I wouldn't be so worried about what they think of me. I think it's possible that I could even start to enjoy activities like playing softball again, without feeling like I'm going to fail or make a mistake.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It's amazing how carrying around that weight of criticism and expectation can have such a profound impact on our lives. It's like you're wearing a coat that's been tailored to fit your parents' image of you, and it's been suffocating you. What would it take for you to start peeling off those layers and finding a coat that's more in line with who you are and who you want to be?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think it would take a lot of self-reflection and acknowledgment of my strengths and accomplishments. I've been so focused on my mistakes and what others think of me that I've forgotten what I'm capable of. I think if I could just take some time to focus on my positive qualities and celebrate my successes, it would help me build more confidence and start to let go of this fear of being judged or perceived as incompetent.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It's remarkable that you're recognizing the impact of those critical voices on your self-talk and relationships. Can you help me understand what it would mean for you to start creating a more compassionate and accepting inner dialogue, one that acknowledges your imperfections and mistakes as opportunities for growth rather than proof of your inadequacy?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>That makes sense. I think if I focused on creating a more compassionate and accepting inner dialogue, I would be more kind and understanding towards myself when I make mistakes. I would remind myself that everyone makes mistakes and that it's okay not to be perfect. I would also focus on what I learned from my mistakes and how I can use that knowledge to improve and grow. I think this would help me build more confidence and self-acceptance, and I would be more willing to take risks and try new things.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're recognizing that your self-criticism has been rooted in a desire to meet others' expectations, and that this has led to feelings of inadequacy and low self-esteem. Can you help me understand what you think would happen if you were to start acknowledging and accepting your own strengths and accomplishments, rather than constantly seeking validation from outside sources?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think if I started acknowledging and accepting my own strengths and accomplishments, I would feel more confident and self-assured. I would be able to focus on my own goals and values, rather than constantly seeking validation from others. I would also be more willing to take risks and try new things, knowing that I have the capability to succeed.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It's interesting to me that you're recognizing the impact of those critical inner voices on your self-talk and relationships. Can you help me understand what it would mean for you to start acknowledging and accepting your imperfections and mistakes as a natural part of the learning process, rather than as evidence of your inadequacy? How might that shift in perspective influence your self-talk and relationships?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think that would mean a significant shift in my inner dialogue, from focusing on my mistakes and perceived failures to acknowledging and accepting my imperfections and mistakes as a natural part of the learning process. I would remind myself that everyone makes mistakes and that it's okay not to be perfect, and I would focus on what I learned from those mistakes and how I can use that knowledge to improve and grow. I think this would help me build more confidence and self-acceptance, and I would be more willing to take risks and try new things.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>As you continue to recognize the impact of those critical inner voices on your self-talk and relationships, it's clear that you're taking a significant step towards developing a more compassionate and accepting inner dialogue. Can you help me understand what specific thoughts or self-statements you might need to challenge or reframe in order to shift your perspective on imperfections and mistakes?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>That's a great question. I think I would need to challenge the thought that I'm a failure when I make a mistake. Instead, I could tell myself that it's okay to make mistakes, that everyone makes them, and that it's an opportunity to learn and grow. I would also need to reframe the thought that I'm not good enough or that I'm pretending to be confident when I'm not. I could remind myself that I'm doing the best I can and that I'm capable of improving and growing.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're recognizing the importance of practicing self-compassion and reframing negative self-talk in order to build confidence and improve your overall well-being. Can you help me understand what small steps you might take to start incorporating more self-compassion into your daily life, such as taking a few deep breaths before responding to a challenging situation or writing down three things you appreciate about yourself each day?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think that's a great idea. I can definitely try to incorporate more self-compassion into my daily life. Maybe I can start by taking a few deep breaths before responding to a challenging situation or writing down three things I appreciate about myself each day. I can also try to be kinder to myself when I make mistakes, reminding myself that everyone makes them and that it's an opportunity to learn and grow.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It's great to see you recognizing the importance of self-compassion and reframing negative self-talk. By acknowledging that everyone makes mistakes and that it's an opportunity to learn and grow, you're taking a significant step towards building confidence and improving your overall well-being. Can you tell me more about what you think would happen if you were to start practicing self-compassion and reframing negative self-talk, and how you think that might impact your relationships with others?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>That's a really good question.

                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>As you continue to explore the impact of self-criticism on your relationships and overall well-being, I want to highlight that it's common for people to struggle with this pattern of thinking, especially when they're deeply ingrained. Would you be open to exploring some strategies for reframing negative self-talk and practicing self-compassion in daily life, and how we might work together to incorporate those into your routine?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I'm glad we're discussing this. I think it's essential to recognize that I'm not alone in this struggle and that it's okay to make mistakes. It's also crucial to understand that my self-criticism is rooted in my childhood experiences and that it's not a reflection of my true worth. By acknowledging and accepting my imperfections and mistakes as a natural part of the learning process, I can start to build more confidence and self-acceptance. I think it would be helpful to work on reframing negative self-talk and practicing self-compassion in daily life, and I'm open to exploring strategies for doing so.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It's interesting to me that you're starting to see the connection between your childhood experiences and your current self-criticism. It's as if you're beginning to untangle the web of negative self-talk that's been influencing your relationships and overall well-being. Can we take a closer look at what specific memories or experiences from your childhood might be contributing to this self-criticism, and how we might be able to reframe those memories in a more compassionate and accepting way?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think it would be helpful to work on reframing negative self-talk and practicing self-compassion in daily life. I'd like to start by writing down three things I appreciate about myself each day and reading them before bed. I'd also like to try to reframe the thought that I'm a failure when I make a mistake by telling myself that it's okay to make mistakes, that everyone makes them, and that it's an opportunity to learn and grow.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>As you've been reflecting on your childhood experiences and how they've influenced your self-talk, I want to normalize this process for you. It's common for people to carry around negative self-talk and self-criticism, especially when they've had critical or judgmental upbringings. In fact, research has shown that our childhood experiences can have a profound impact on our adult self-talk and relationship with ourselves. Would you like to explore some strategies for reframing your childhood memories and re-writing a more compassionate narrative about yourself?</div>

                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think it's interesting that you're saying that my self-criticism is rooted in my childhood experiences. It makes sense that my parents' criticism and high expectations would have had a lasting impact on my self-talk and relationships. I've always known that their criticism was hurtful and unfair, but I never really stopped to think about how it's shaped my self-perception and behavior over the years. By acknowledging and accepting those childhood experiences, I'm starting to see that my self-criticism is not a reflection of my true worth, but rather a coping mechanism that I developed as a way to deal with the pressure and stress of my childhood. It's like I've been carrying around this heavy burden of self-doubt and fear of failure, and it's been suffocating me.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>As you continue to explore the connection between your childhood experiences and your self-talk, I want to emphasize that it's essential to be kind and compassionate towards yourself as you work through these emotions. Can you tell me more about what you think would happen if you were able to develop a more compassionate inner dialogue, one that acknowledges the challenges you faced in childhood and the ways in which they have affected your self-talk and relationships?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think that developing a more compassionate inner dialogue would mean acknowledging that I'm not a failure just because I make mistakes. It would mean reminding myself that everyone makes mistakes, and that it's an opportunity to learn and grow. I would focus on what I've learned from my mistakes and how I can use that knowledge to improve and grow. I would also remind myself that I'm doing the best I can, and that I'm capable of improving and growing.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It's wonderful that you're starting to recognize the connection between your childhood experiences and your current self-talk and relationships. Can you help me understand what specific memories or moments stand out to you as particularly influential in shaping your self-criticism, and how you think acknowledging and accepting those experiences might help you develop a more compassionate relationship with yourself?</div>

                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It's fascinating to see how your childhood experiences have had a ripple effect on your current self-talk and relationships. Research has shown that our early experiences can shape our brain's wiring, influencing our thought patterns and behaviors in ways that can be challenging to change. But here's the thing: it's never too late to rewire those patterns and develop new ways of thinking. What do you think would be the most empowering step for you to take in order to start reframing those childhood memories and re-writing a more compassionate narrative about yourself?</div>

By recognizing the ways in which those experiences have shaped your self-talk and relationships, you're creating space to reframe your narrative and cultivate a more compassionate relationship with yourself. I'd like to build on that by exploring how you can use mindfulness and self-compassion to rewire your brain and develop a more positive self-image.
