                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Hello, Gregory. I’m glad you’re here today. How are you feeling right now?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I've been trying to understand why my wife has been so distant. I think it all started around the time I lost my job. I feel like a failure and it's impacting our relationship.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're going through a really tough time, and it's understandable that you're struggling to connect with your wife right now. Can you help me understand more about what's changed in your interactions with her since you lost your job? Are there specific conversations or moments that stand out to you as feeling distant or disconnected?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah, definitely. One thing that's changed is the way we used to have conversations about our daily lives. We would talk about our jobs, our interests, and just life in general. But now, when I try to bring up those topics, my wife seems detached and uninterested. It's like she's not even listening to what I'm saying. It's really frustrating and makes me feel like I'm not important to her anymore.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're really struggling to reconcile the person you used to be, with the person you feel you've become after losing your job. Can you help me understand what you think your wife might be thinking or feeling when you initiate these conversations, and if there's a specific moment or conversation that stands out to you as being particularly difficult or unproductive?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>That's a great point, I never thought about it that way. I think my wife might be feeling overwhelmed with her own stress and responsibilities, and maybe she's not sure how to handle her emotions around my job loss. I remember one specific conversation where I tried to talk to her about my feelings, and she just got really quiet and didn't respond. It was like she didn't know what to say, and it felt like a huge burden was placed on me to fix everything.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're feeling a sense of responsibility to fix everything and make your wife's stress and worries go away, which is taking a toll on your feelings of importance and connection in your relationship. It's understandable that you're struggling to find the right words or ways to support each other during difficult times, especially when it comes to sensitive topics like job loss. Can you tell me more about what you think it would take for you to feel like you're being heard and understood by your wife, even in the midst of all this uncertainty and difficulty?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>That's a great question. I think it would take a lot of effort and understanding from both of us to communicate effectively. Maybe we need to find ways to show empathy and support each other instead of just talking about our problems. I also think that we need to establish some ground rules for our conversations, like setting aside dedicated time to talk and not interrupting each other. Additionally, I think it would be helpful if we could find ways to celebrate our small successes, even if they're not related to our jobs, to help us stay positive and motivated.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>As you explore these ideas and strategies, I want to acknowledge that it's not always easy to make changes in our relationships, especially when we've been stuck in certain patterns for a while. It's like trying to break a habit - it takes time, effort, and patience. Can you tell me what's been the most challenging part of trying to make these changes so far, and how do you think you can build on the small successes you've had to keep making progress?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think what's been the most challenging part is breaking the pattern of feeling like I'm the one who needs to fix everything and make my wife's stress and worries go away. It's like I've been carrying that burden by myself, and it's exhausting. But at the same time, I can see how my wife might be feeling overwhelmed and unsure of how to handle her emotions around my job loss. I think what would really help is if we could find ways to communicate more openly and honestly with each other, and maybe even set aside some dedicated time to talk and support each other. It would be great to feel like we're working together as a team, rather than just me trying to fix everything.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It's great to see you acknowledging the interconnectedness of your struggles and recognizing the need for a more collaborative approach. Can you help me understand what you hope to achieve by breaking free from the pattern of feeling like you need to fix everything, and how you envision that shift impacting your communication and overall relationship dynamic?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think breaking free from this pattern would allow me to feel more empowered and less burdened, and it would also allow me to have more meaningful conversations with my wife. I envision us being able to communicate more openly and honestly, and maybe even find ways to support each other that aren't just focused on solving problems. I'd like to feel like we're working together as a team, rather than just me trying to fix everything.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like carrying the burden of fixing everything on your own has been a heavy load, and you're looking for ways to share that weight with your wife. Can you think of any small, specific ways you could start to ask for her help and support, rather than waiting for her to initiate conversations or solutions?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>That's a great question. I think I've been so focused on trying to fix everything that I haven't really given my wife the opportunity to help or support me. Maybe I can start by asking her how she's doing and what's been going on in her life, and then see if there are any ways I can support her. I've also been thinking about starting a journal to track my feelings and thoughts, which might help me process my emotions and gain some clarity on what's been going on.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>As you're recognizing the importance of sharing the burden with your wife, I'm curious to explore what specific changes you've noticed in your relationship since the job loss, and how you think her involvement could help alleviate some of the stress and pressure you're feeling.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah, I think what's been the most surprising thing is how my wife's responses to me have changed. Before, she would always listen to me and offer advice, but now it's like she's just going through the motions. It's like she's not even really there, and it's really disheartening. I think it's because she's feeling overwhelmed too, but I don't know how to help her or even talk to her about it.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like the dynamics between you and your wife have changed significantly since your job loss, and it's like you're both struggling to find a new rhythm in your relationship. It's normal to feel like you're getting stuck in a rut, especially when you're dealing with uncertainty and change. Can you help me understand what you think is the most significant aspect of your wife's responses that has changed, and how you think that's impacting your feelings of connection and importance in the relationship?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>It's like my wife's responses have become really superficial now. Before, we would have deep conversations about our hopes and dreams, but now it's like we're just going through the motions. She'll ask me how my day was, but it's like she's not really interested in hearing the answer. It's like we're just pretending to be interested in each other, and it's really hard for me to feel connected to someone who's not really present in our conversations.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It's interesting that you mention feeling like you're just going through the motions, and I completely understand why that would be frustrating for you. It's natural to want to feel like you're being heard and understood by your partner, and it's understandable that you're feeling like that's missing in your conversations with your wife. Can you tell me more about what you think is missing from your conversations, and how you think you can start to rebuild that emotional intimacy you're craving?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think what's missing from our conversations is the sense of emotional intimacy and connection. We used to be able to talk about our hopes and dreams, and it felt like we were really listening to each other. Now, it feels like we're just going through the motions, and it's like we're not even really present in our conversations. I think we need to find ways to rebuild that emotional intimacy, maybe by setting aside dedicated time to talk and not interrupting each other. It would also be helpful if we could find ways to show empathy and support each other, rather than just talking about our problems.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It's as if you're recognizing that your attachment style might be influencing the way you interact with your wife, and that's a really important awareness to have. Can you tell me more about what you think your attachment style is, and how you think it's impacting your relationship?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think my attachment style is anxious-preoccupied, which means I tend to worry a lot about rejection and abandonment. In my relationship, this means I often try to control the conversation and make sure my wife is happy, just in case she leaves me. I also tend to get really upset when she doesn't respond the way I want her to, which can lead to feelings of loneliness and isolation. But the more I think about it, the more I realize that my wife's behavior might not be about me at all - maybe she's just stressed out and overwhelmed, like you said. If that's the case, then I need to learn to communicate more effectively and support her, rather than trying to control the situation. This feels like a really important realization for me, and I'm not sure what to do with it.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It makes sense that recognizing your attachment style's impact on your relationship has been a significant awareness for you, and it's normal to feel uncertain about what to do with this new understanding. One thing that might be helpful is to explore how your wife's attachment style might be influencing her behavior and interactions with you, as understanding each other's attachment needs can be a powerful way to build a more secure and fulfilling relationship. Can you tell me more about what you think you might need to feel more secure and less anxious in your relationship, and how you think you could start to work on building a more secure attachment with your wife?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think what's been holding me back is the fear of rejection and abandonment. I've always been worried that my wife might leave me or stop loving me if I'm not successful or if I'm not the perfect partner. That's why I've been trying to control the conversation and make sure she's happy, just in case she changes her mind. But now that I've realized that my wife might be stressed out and overwhelmed, I need to learn to communicate more effectively and support her, rather than trying to control the situation. This feels like a huge burden has been lifted off my shoulders, and I feel more hopeful about our relationship. I think we can work on building a more secure attachment by setting aside dedicated time to talk and not interrupting each other, and by showing empathy and support for each other.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're recognizing the importance of understanding and supporting each other's attachment needs in your relationship, and that's a great step forward. As you continue to explore this new understanding, I want to gently challenge you to consider what would happen if you were to take ownership of your own emotions and needs, rather than constantly trying to control the situation or ensure your wife's happiness. How might that shift impact your interactions with your wife, and what do you think would be the benefits of this new approach?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think it's really interesting to consider what would happen if I were to take ownership of my own emotions and needs, rather than constantly trying to control the situation or ensure my wife's happiness. It's like I've been so focused on trying to fix everything and make my wife happy that I've forgotten about my own needs and feelings. If I were to take ownership of my emotions and needs, I think it would be a huge relief and would allow me to feel more authentic and real in my relationship. I would no longer feel like I'm walking on eggshells, trying to avoid conflict or rejection. I think it would also allow me to communicate more openly and honestly with my wife, and to establish a deeper sense of connection and intimacy with her.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're recognizing the importance of taking ownership of your own emotions and needs in your relationship, and that's a significant shift for you. Can you help me understand what you think would be the most significant challenge in making this shift, and how you think you might overcome that challenge in your interactions with your wife?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think the most significant challenge would be letting go of the need to control the situation and my wife's happiness. I've been so used to trying to fix everything and make sure she's happy that it's become a habit. I'm worried that if I stop trying to control everything, things will fall apart and my wife will leave me. But at the same time, I'm also worried that if I don't start taking ownership of my own emotions and needs, I'll continue to feel stuck and unhappy in my relationship. It's a scary thought to let go of the control, but I think it's necessary if I want to build a more authentic and fulfilling relationship with my wife.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>As you've been exploring this new awareness, I'm struck by how it's already begun to shift your perspective on your relationship. Can you tell me more about what you think would happen if you were to continue down this path of taking ownership of your own emotions and needs, and how you envision that would impact your interactions with your wife?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think it's really interesting to consider what would happen if I were to take ownership of my own emotions and needs, rather than constantly trying to control the situation or ensure my wife's happiness.

                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It's clear that you're making significant progress in recognizing the importance of taking ownership of your own emotions and needs in your relationship. By acknowledging this, you're opening yourself up to a more authentic and fulfilling dynamic with your wife. As you continue down this path, I want to encourage you to explore the idea that building a stronger sense of self-awareness and emotional intelligence can be a powerful tool in navigating conflicts and improving communication with your wife. Can you tell me more about what you think you'd need to work on to develop your emotional intelligence and how you envision that would impact your interactions with your wife?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think developing my emotional intelligence would be incredibly helpful in my relationship with my wife. I feel like I've been so focused on trying to control the situation and ensure her happiness that I've neglected my own emotional needs and feelings. If I were to take the time to understand and acknowledge my own emotions, I think it would allow me to communicate more openly and honestly with my wife, and to establish a deeper sense of connection and intimacy with her. I'd need to work on becoming more aware of my emotions, learning how to label and validate them, and developing skills to manage and regulate my emotions in a healthy way. I think this would also help me to recognize and understand my wife's emotions better, and to respond to her in a more empathetic and supportive way.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>As you're exploring this new awareness of taking ownership of your emotions and needs, it's interesting that you're considering how this might impact your interactions with your wife.

Building a more secure attachment with your wife, as I mentioned earlier, can be a powerful way to achieve that. Can you help me understand how you think you can start to prioritize your own emotional needs and desires in your interactions with her, and what specific boundaries or communication strategies you think would be most helpful for you to establish in order to make that happen?</div>
