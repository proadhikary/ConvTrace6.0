                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Hello, Russell. Iâ€™m glad you could make it today. How are you feeling right now?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I just feel like no matter what I do, I'm never going to get out of this rut. It's like I'm stuck in this never-ending cycle of dead-end jobs.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're feeling really trapped and frustrated, like you're not making any progress or moving forward in your career, and that's affecting your overall sense of happiness and motivation. Can you help me understand what you think is causing this sense of stagnation, and what you think would need to happen for you to feel like you're making progress and moving forward?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I don't know, it's just like, no matter what I do, it's always the same thing. I apply to jobs, I attend workshops, but nothing seems to work. It's like I'm just stuck in this rut and I don't know how to get out of it.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're feeling really stuck and uncertain about what the future holds, and that's a lot to deal with. Can you tell me more about what's going through your mind when you think about your career and where you want to be in the next few years? What are some things that you used to enjoy about your work or aspects of your career that you feel like are missing right now?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I used to enjoy the fast-paced environment of a kitchen, the sense of accomplishment when a busy shift goes smoothly, and the camaraderie with my coworkers. But now, I just feel like I'm going through the motions, and I don't see any opportunities for growth or advancement. It's like I'm just a cog in a machine, and I'm not making any meaningful contributions.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It's interesting that you mention feeling like you're not making meaningful contributions, and that's affecting your sense of purpose and fulfillment. Can you help me understand what you mean by meaningful contributions? Is it about making a tangible impact, or is it more about feeling like you're part of a team and contributing to a larger goal? And how do you think your current role compares to your previous roles or roles you've had in the past in terms of the sense of contribution you feel?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah, I used to feel like I was making a difference in the kitchen, like my work was important and that I was part of a team. But now, it just feels like I'm just a cog in a machine, like I'm just doing the same thing over and over again without any sense of purpose or fulfillment.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It's interesting that you mention feeling like you're not being valued or recognized for your work, because often when we feel unseen, it can lead to feelings of disconnection and unimportance. Can you tell me more about what you think would change if you were to start feeling more valued and recognized by your coworkers and supervisors? Would that make a big difference for you?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I don't know, it sounds like a pipe dream. I mean, I've been in this industry for years and I've never seen anyone get promoted or recognized for their work. It's just a bunch of people pushing to get to the top and then moving on to something else. I don't see why I would be any different.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're carrying a heavy sense of skepticism and cynicism about the possibility of growth and recognition in your industry, and that's understandable given the experiences you've had so far. Can you help me understand what specifically has led you to feel this way? Was there a particular incident or conversation that made you realize that advancement opportunities are limited?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>It's hard for me to even imagine a scenario where I'm valued and recognized, because it seems like that's not something that happens in this industry. I've seen so many people come and go, and no one ever stays in one place for long. It's like everyone is just trying to get ahead and then move on to something else. I don't know why I would be any different.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're carrying a heavy dose of reality and experience, and it's understandable that that would make it hard for you to imagine a different scenario. Can you help me understand what you think would need to change in order for you to even consider the possibility of growth and recognition? Is it about changing the culture of the industry, or is it about shifting your own perspective on what's possible?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I don't know, it's just like, I've been in this industry for so long and I've seen so many people come and go, and no one ever stays in one place for long. It's like everyone is just trying to get ahead and then move on to something else. I don't see why I would be any different.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're really struggling to see a way out of this cycle, and it's hard not to take the evidence of those around you as a sign that this is just the way things are. Can you help me understand what you think would happen if you were to start to question that assumption, even just a little bit? What would need to change for you to start to think that maybe, just maybe, there's more to the story than what you're seeing on the surface?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>It's hard for me to imagine a different scenario because it feels like I've been conditioned to believe that this is the way things are. Everyone I know is stuck in their own way, and it's like I'm just supposed to accept that this is my fate too. But deep down, I know that's not true. I know that there are people out there who have made a difference and found success, and I want that for myself.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're carrying a heavy load of self-doubt and fear of not living up to your own expectations, and that's really understandable. Can you help me understand what you think would happen if you were to start to separate your identity from your sense of career stagnation? What would need to change for you to start to see yourself as more than just a short order cook, and for your career to start feeling more like a reflection of your values and aspirations?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah, I know it's not true that I'm just supposed to accept that this is my fate. I know there are people out there who have made a difference and found success, and I want that for myself.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>As you explore these questions and challenges, I want to acknowledge that it's not always easy to take a step back and re-evaluate our assumptions, especially when they're deeply ingrained. It's almost as if we're trying to redefine our own reality, and that can be a daunting task. Can you tell me more about what you think would need to happen for you to feel like you're making progress and moving forward, even if it's just a small step?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I don't know, it's just like, I've been doing this for so long, and I have this feeling that I'm just going to keep feeling stuck and unhappy until I get out of this industry. But at the same time, I'm scared to leave because I don't know what else I would do, and I don't have any other skills or experience. It's like I'm trapped in this never-ending cycle of self-doubt and fear.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're carrying a heavy sense of uncertainty and fear around the idea of leaving this industry, and that's completely understandable. It's natural to feel trapped when we're not sure what the next step is. Can you help me understand what specifically is driving your fear of leaving this industry, is it the fear of the unknown, or is there something else at play here?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think it's a combination of both. I'm scared of the unknown, but I'm also scared of not being able to find something that fulfills me the way this job used to. I'm afraid that I'll just be trading one stuck situation for another, and that's a really daunting thought for me.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It's amazing how often our fears and uncertainties can feel like insurmountable barriers, isn't it? And it sounds like you're experiencing that firsthand. Can you help me understand what you think would happen if you were to break down this fear of the unknown into smaller, more manageable pieces? What would you need to feel like you're taking control of the situation and making progress towards a more fulfilling career?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think I've been so focused on the negative aspects of my job and industry that I've forgotten what I'm truly passionate about. I used to love cooking and making people happy with my food, but now it just feels like a chore. I think I need to start exploring other options and taking small steps towards a more fulfilling career. But, it's scary to leave the comfort of what I know, even if it's not making me happy.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you've been feeling really disconnected from your passion for cooking and that's been contributing to your sense of stagnation. Can you help me understand what specific aspects of cooking brought you joy and fulfillment in the past, and how you think you might be able to rekindle that spark in a new way?</div>

                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It's amazing how easily we can lose touch with what brings us joy and fulfillment in our work, isn't it? It sounds like you've been so focused on the demands of your job that you've neglected your own passions and values. Can you help me understand what specific aspects of cooking brought you joy and fulfillment in the past, and how you think you might be able to rekindle that spark in a new way?</div>
