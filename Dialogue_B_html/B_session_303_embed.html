                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Hello, Leonard. It's nice to meet you. How are you feeling today?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I've been feeling a bit down lately because I keep thinking that my grandpa is disappointed in me. A few months ago, I made a mistake, and since then, I've been interpreting his actions as signs of my inadequacy.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>I can see how this would be really tough for you, Leonard. It's understandable that you'd feel like you're walking on eggshells around your grandpa, not knowing if you're doing things right or if he's going to criticize you. Can you tell me more about what you think would happen if you could have a conversation with your grandpa about how you're feeling? Would you be able to clear the air and move forward, or do you think it would be too difficult to bring up the subject?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>That's a great question. I think if I could have a conversation with my grandpa about how I'm feeling, I would probably feel relieved and like I've finally told him how I've been feeling all this time. I'm not sure if it would be too difficult to bring up the subject, but I think it would be worth it to clear the air and move forward.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like the weight of these assumptions has been holding you back, Leonard, and that's a really common experience. Can you tell me more about what you think would happen if you were to bring up the subject with your grandpa, and what you hope would come out of that conversation?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>That's a great point. I think if I were to bring up the subject with my grandpa, I would hope that he would be understanding and acknowledge that he's been feeling disappointed in me. I would also hope that he would reassure me that he still loves me and that the mistake I made doesn't define me as a person.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like a huge burden is already being carried by you, Leonard, and it's no wonder you're feeling stuck in this cycle of self-doubt. Research has shown that when we assume others' thoughts and feelings without actually communicating with them, it can lead to a phenomenon called persecutory warrant, where we create our own evidence for these assumptions. Would you be willing to explore with me what you think might happen if you were to challenge these assumptions and have an open and honest conversation with your grandpa?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>That's a great point, and I think it's something that I haven't considered before. I've been so focused on my own feelings and what I think my grandpa is thinking that I haven't stopped to think about how my own thoughts might be creating this cycle of self-doubt. I'm willing to explore this further and see if there's a way to challenge these assumptions and have a more open and honest conversation with my grandpa.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're already taking a huge step forward by acknowledging the impact of these assumptions on your life, Leonard. Can you tell me more about what you think would happen if you were to have a conversation with your grandpa that's more centered around your own feelings and needs, rather than trying to guess what he might be thinking?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think if I were to have a conversation with my grandpa that's more centered around my own feelings and needs, I would feel more empowered and less anxious about the potential outcome. I would be able to express my feelings and concerns in a clear and respectful way, and I would be more likely to receive a response that addresses my needs and validates my emotions.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>As you've shared, Leonard, it's clear that the weight of these assumptions has been carrying over into your daily life and relationships. It's understandable that you'd want to take a step back and re-evaluate how you're approaching conversations with your grandpa. Can you tell me more about what you hope to achieve from this conversation with your grandpa? Is there a specific outcome or understanding you're looking for, or is it more about taking a step towards a more open and honest communication?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>That's a great question. I think what I hope to achieve from this conversation with my grandpa is to feel more understood and validated. I want to know that my feelings and concerns are being heard and acknowledged, and that he's not just dismissing me or my feelings. I'm not necessarily looking for a specific outcome or understanding, but rather a sense of closure and relief that comes from being able to express myself openly and honestly.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It's interesting to note that when we're feeling misunderstood or dismissed, it can actually activate our brain's threat response, which can make it even harder to communicate effectively. Have you noticed any physical sensations or emotions that arise when you think about having a conversation with your grandpa?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think I've noticed that when I'm thinking about having a conversation with my grandpa, I tend to feel a knot in my stomach and my heart starts racing. It's like my body is preparing for some kind of attack or rejection. I also feel a sense of anxiety and nervousness, like I'm walking on eggshells, waiting for him to say something that will validate my fears.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It makes sense that you'd feel this way, given the history and dynamics you've shared with your grandpa. Can you help me understand what you're hoping to achieve from this conversation with him? Are you looking for validation, apology, or something else entirely?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think I've been so focused on trying to guess what my grandpa is thinking and feeling that I haven't stopped to think about what I really need from this conversation. I want to feel heard and validated, like my feelings and concerns are being acknowledged and respected. I also hope that we can have a more open and honest conversation, where we can both express ourselves freely and honestly, without fear of judgment or rejection.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>As you've been carrying this weight of assumptions and self-doubt, it's not surprising that you're feeling overwhelmed and uncertain about how to move forward. Can you help me understand what you think would be the most empowering outcome from this conversation with your grandpa, and how that might shift your dynamics with him in the long run?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think the most empowering outcome from this conversation with my grandpa would be if we could have an open and honest discussion about my feelings and concerns, and if he could acknowledge and validate my emotions. This would help me feel more understood and respected, and it would also give me the confidence to express myself more freely and honestly in the future.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>As you're preparing for this conversation with your grandpa, it's essential to recognize that it's okay to prioritize your own emotional needs and well-being. In fact, research has shown that when we prioritize our own emotional safety, we're more likely to experience empathy and understanding from others. Can you tell me more about what you think would happen if you were to set some boundaries and prioritize your own needs in this conversation?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think setting boundaries and prioritizing my own needs in this conversation would allow me to feel more grounded and centered, rather than walking on eggshells and trying to guess what my grandpa is thinking. By being clear about my own feelings and needs, I would be able to communicate more effectively and assertively, which would help me feel more empowered and respected.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>As you think about what you need to feel grounded and centered in this conversation, I want to acknowledge that it's a big ask to prioritize your own emotional needs, especially when it comes to a significant relationship like the one with your grandpa. It's normal to feel uncertain about how he might react, and it's natural to worry about causing tension or conflict. Can you help me understand what you think would happen if you were to take a step back and focus on your own emotional well-being, rather than trying to predict or control your grandpa's reaction?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think taking a step back and focusing on my own emotional well-being would allow me to approach the conversation with my grandpa in a more authentic and empowered way. By prioritizing my own needs and feelings, I would be able to communicate more clearly and assertively, which would help me feel more respected and understood. It's scary to think about potentially causing tension or conflict, but I realize that it's a risk worth taking if it means being able to express myself more freely and honestly.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>As you've recognized the importance of prioritizing your own emotional well-being in this conversation with your grandpa, I want to acknowledge that it's a huge step to take. It's natural to worry about how he might react, especially given your history and the power dynamic involved. Can you help me understand what you think would happen if you were to approach the conversation with a sense of curiosity and openness, rather than trying to predict or control the outcome?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think approaching the conversation with a sense of curiosity and openness would allow me to stay present and focused on my own emotional needs, rather than getting caught up in trying to predict or control the outcome. By being open to whatever my grandpa may say or do, I would be able to respond in a more authentic and empowered way, rather than reacting out of fear or anxiety. This would also help me to stay grounded and centered, even if the conversation doesn't go exactly as I hope.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>As you're considering this, I want to acknowledge that it sounds like you're already taking a big step towards prioritizing your own emotional well-being by thinking about what you need to feel grounded and centered in this conversation with your grandpa. That takes a lot of courage, and it's not always easy to do. Can you tell me more about what you think might happen if you were to approach this conversation with a sense of curiosity and openness, rather than trying to predict or control the outcome?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think approaching the conversation with a sense of curiosity and openness would allow me to explore the possibility that my grandpa's disappointment is not about me as a person, but rather about the specific situation that happened. I would be able to listen to his perspective and respond in a way that is authentic and honest, rather than trying to defend myself or justify my actions. This would also give me the opportunity to learn more about my grandpa's values and expectations, which could help me grow and develop as a person. By being open to whatever my grandpa may say or do, I would be able to respond in a way that is respectful and empathetic, rather than reacting out of fear or anxiety.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>As you explore the possibility of approaching the conversation with your grandpa with a sense of curiosity and openness, I want to acknowledge that it's not always easy to do so, especially when there's a sense of power dynamics at play. It sounds like you're already taking a big step forward by considering what you need to feel grounded and centered in this conversation. Can you help me understand what specific strategies or coping mechanisms you've used in the past to regulate your emotions and stay present in situations that feel uncertain or overwhelming?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I've used deep breathing exercises and physical exercise to help regulate my emotions and stay present in situations that feel uncertain or overwhelming. When I'm feeling anxious or overwhelmed, I try to take a few deep breaths and focus on the sensation of the breath moving in and out of my body. This helps me to calm down and feel more grounded. I also find that physical exercise, such as going for a walk or doing some yoga, helps me to release tension and feel more centered.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you've developed some effective coping strategies to regulate your emotions and stay present in challenging situations, Leonard. By recognizing the value of these strategies, you're acknowledging that you're capable of taking care of yourself, even in uncertain or overwhelming situations. Can you help me understand how you think you might be able to apply these strategies to this specific conversation with your grandpa, and what you might need from yourself to feel more confident and grounded in that moment?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think I can apply my deep breathing exercises to help me stay present and focused during the conversation with my grandpa. I also plan to use physical exercise beforehand to release any tension or anxiety I may be feeling. To feel more confident and grounded during the conversation, I think I would need to remind myself that I am taking care of myself and prioritizing my own emotional well-being. I would also need to focus on my own feelings and needs, rather than trying to guess what my grandpa is thinking or feeling. By doing so, I believe I can approach the conversation with a sense of clarity and confidence, rather than uncertainty and anxiety.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>As you've shared, Leonard, it's clear that you're already taking a thoughtful approach to preparing for this conversation with your grandpa. It's normal to feel a sense of uncertainty and self-doubt, especially when navigating a complex emotional situation like this one. Can you help me understand what you think would happen if you were to approach this conversation with a sense of curiosity and openness, rather than trying to predict or control the outcome? How do you think your grandpa might respond, and what do you think you might learn from each other if you approach the conversation with a sense of mutual respect and understanding?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think approaching the conversation with my grandpa with a sense of curiosity and openness would allow me to stay present and focused on my own emotional needs, rather than getting caught up in trying to predict or control the outcome.

                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>As you're considering approaching this conversation with a sense of curiosity and openness, I want to acknowledge that it's not uncommon to feel uncertain about how to navigate complex emotional situations like this one. It's almost as if your mind is trying to predict every possible outcome, which can be overwhelming. Can you help me understand what you think would happen if you were to let go of the need to control the outcome and instead focus on being present in the moment with your grandpa?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think if I were to let go of the need to control the outcome and instead focus on being present in the moment with my grandpa, I would be able to respond more authentically and honestly to whatever he says or does. I would be able to listen more deeply and understand his perspective, rather than trying to anticipate or prepare for a specific response. By doing so, I believe I would be able to build a stronger and more meaningful connection with my grandpa, rather than getting caught up in my own fears and assumptions.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>I think what stands out to me, Leonard, is that you're recognizing the importance of prioritizing your own emotional well-being in this conversation with your grandpa. It's not just about trying to change his mind or get a specific outcome, but rather about being present and authentic in the moment. How do you think this shift in focus might impact the way you approach the conversation, and what do you think you might gain from taking this more self-compassionate approach?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>That's a great question. I think if I were to approach the conversation with my grandpa with a sense of curiosity and openness, I would be able to respond more authentically and honestly to whatever he says or does.

                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>As you've been reflecting on what it would mean to prioritize your own emotional well-being in this conversation with your grandpa, I want to acknowledge that it can be really challenging to balance your own needs with the desire to please or avoid conflict with someone you care about. Can you help me understand what you think would happen if you were to acknowledge and accept your own emotions, rather than trying to suppress or deny them, and how that might impact your interaction with your grandpa?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think acknowledging and accepting my own emotions would allow me to approach the conversation with my grandpa in a more authentic and honest way. By recognizing and accepting my feelings, I would be able to express myself more clearly and assertively, rather than trying to hide or deny them. This would also help me to stay grounded and centered, even in the face of uncertainty or conflict. I believe that by acknowledging and accepting my own emotions, I would be able to build a stronger and more meaningful connection with my grandpa, rather than getting caught up in my own fears and assumptions.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>As you consider acknowledging and accepting your own emotions in this conversation with your grandpa, I want to acknowledge that it can be a vulnerable and scary process. It's natural to worry about how he might react, especially if you're used to trying to hide or suppress your emotions. Can you help me understand what you think would happen if you were to take a step back and acknowledge your own emotions, rather than trying to judge or shame yourself for feeling a certain way? For example, if you were to say to yourself, I'm feeling really anxious about this conversation, but that's okay, I'm allowing myself to feel it.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think acknowledging and accepting my own emotions would be a huge relief, to be honest. It's like I've been trying to carry this weight of self-doubt and anxiety around for so long, and it's exhausting. By allowing myself to feel my emotions, I would be able to release that burden and approach the conversation with my grandpa in a more authentic and honest way. I think it would be liberating to be able to acknowledge and accept my feelings, rather than trying to suppress or deny them.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It's interesting that you're considering the possibility of apologizing to your grandpa, Leonard. Can you help me understand what you think would happen if you were to take a step back and focus on your own emotional needs in this situation, rather than trying to meet your grandpa's expectations or make things right according to your own sense of morality? By acknowledging and accepting your own emotions, you might be able to identify what you need from this conversation to feel more grounded and centered.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think that's a great point. I've been so focused on trying to make things right and avoid conflict that I haven't stopped to think about what I need from this conversation. If I were to take a step back and focus on my own emotional needs, I would probably need to feel heard and validated by my grandpa. I would need to know that he understands where I'm coming from and that he's not just dismissing my feelings. By doing so, I would feel more empowered and respected, rather than anxious and uncertain.</div>
