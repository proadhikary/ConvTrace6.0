                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Hi Gerald, welcome to the session. I appreciate your willingness to seek counseling. How can I support you today?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think it might be a fear of wasting time on a story that doesn't end well. I've tried focusing on the positive aspects, but the endings always overshadow everything.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>I understand how frustrating that is for you, feeling like the fear of wasting time is just holding you back from fully immersing yourself in a good book. It's almost like your mind is constantly debating whether the potential disappointment is worth the investment of your time and emotions. Can you tell me more about what you mean by wasting time? Is it about meeting certain expectations, feeling like you've made a bad choice, or something else entirely?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah, I think it's about feeling like I've invested so much time and emotions into a story, only to have it not pay off in the end. It's like I'm constantly wondering if I could've spent that time on something better.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like this fear of wasting time has become a significant burden for you, Gerald, and it's affecting your ability to fully engage with reading, which is a source of great joy for many people. Can you help me understand what you think would happen if you were to let go of this fear and simply allow yourself to enjoy the process of reading, without worrying about the outcome?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I'm not sure. I think I would feel anxious about not knowing what's going to happen next, and that anxiety would make it hard for me to relax and enjoy the story.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>As you're reading, do you find that your mind is constantly racing ahead, trying to predict what's going to happen next, or are you able to focus on the present moment and engage with the characters and story?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah, my mind is always racing ahead, trying to predict what's going to happen next. I'm so focused on the ending that I'm not really enjoying the journey.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're really caught up in the need to know what's going to happen next, and that's making it difficult for you to fully immerse yourself in the story. Can you help me understand what you think would happen if you were able to let go of that need to control the outcome and simply focus on the experience of reading, without worrying about what happens next?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah, I think if I could let go of that need to control the outcome, I might be able to enjoy the journey more and not feel so anxious about the ending. But it's hard for me to imagine doing that, because I've always been someone who likes to know what's going to happen next.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're really struggling with the uncertainty that comes with not knowing what's going to happen next, and that's making it hard for you to take that leap and let go of your need for control. Can you tell me more about what you think would happen if you were to confront that uncertainty head-on, rather than trying to avoid it by focusing on the ending?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah, I think if I could let go of that need to control the outcome, I might be able to enjoy the journey more and not feel so anxious about the ending. But it's hard for me to imagine doing that, because I've always been someone who likes to know what's going to happen next.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like this need for control is deeply rooted in your sense of self and identity, Gerald, and that's making it tough for you to let go of that need for control in your reading habits. Can you help me understand what you think would happen if you were to challenge this need for control and take a step towards embracing the uncertainty that comes with reading?</div>

                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It's interesting that you've been thinking about this need for control in the context of reading, and how it's tied to your sense of self and identity. Can you help me understand what you think would happen if you were to challenge this need for control and take a step towards embracing the uncertainty that comes with reading? How do you think that might impact your sense of self and your ability to enjoy the process of reading?</div>

                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like this sense of uncertainty is really weighing on you, Gerald, and it's affecting your ability to fully immerse yourself in a story. Can you help me understand what you think is the root of this need for control, and whether you're aware of any times in your life where you've felt a similar sense of frustration or disappointment due to uncertainty?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think it's interesting that I've been so focused on the endings of books, because it's like I'm trying to control the outcome of my own life. I've always been someone who likes to know what's going to happen next, and I think that's carried over into my reading habits.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're recognizing that your need for control in your reading habits might be tied to a deeper desire for control in your life, and that's a really important insight. Can you help me understand what you think would happen if you were to challenge this need for control and take a step towards embracing uncertainty in other areas of your life, not just in your reading? How do you think that might impact your sense of self and your relationships with others?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think that's a good point. I've been so focused on the endings of books that it's like I'm trying to control the outcome of my own life. I've always been someone who likes to know what's going to happen next, and I think that's carried over into my reading habits.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>As you're recognizing this pattern, it's natural to feel a mix of emotions - from frustration to curiosity. It's almost as if your mind is trying to make sense of this need for control, and that's a big ask. Can you tell me more about what you think it would take for you to start exploring this need for control in a more intentional way, and what kind of support or resources do you think you might need to help you through that process?</div>

                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>As you're recognizing this pattern in your reading habits, it's also important to acknowledge that it's not uncommon for people to struggle with uncertainty and unpredictability. Many of us have a natural tendency to want to control our environment and the people in it, and it's only when we're forced to confront uncertainty that we realize just how much we've been taking control for granted. Can you help me understand what you think would happen if you were to start embracing the uncertainty that comes with reading, and potentially even in other areas of your life?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think it's getting clearer to me that my need for control is tied to a deeper desire for control in my life. It's not just about the ending of a book, but about feeling like I have some sense of control over the unpredictability of life. I'm starting to see that my fixation on the ending of a book is just a manifestation of this deeper need, and that's a really uncomfortable realization.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>As you're recognizing this connection between your need for control in your reading habits and your deeper desire for control in your life, it's natural to feel a mix of emotions, including discomfort, Gerald. It's like you're being asked to confront a part of yourself that you may have been avoiding or dismissing. Can you help me understand what you think it would take for you to start exploring this deeper desire for control in a more intentional way, and how you think that might impact your relationships with others?</div>

                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It's fascinating to see how this need for control is showing up in your reading habits, and how it might be tied to a deeper desire for control in your life. The uncertainty that comes with reading can be overwhelming, but it's also an opportunity to practice flexibility and adaptability. By acknowledging and accepting this uncertainty, you might find that you're able to approach other areas of your life with a similar sense of openness and curiosity, rather than feeling the need to control every outcome.</div>

In fact, research suggests that many of us have a natural tendency to avoid uncertainty, which can lead to feelings of anxiety and discomfort. But it's also important to recognize that embracing uncertainty can be a powerful way to grow and learn, and that it's okay to not have all the answers. Can you help me understand what you think would happen if you were to start practicing mindfulness and acceptance in your daily life, and how that might impact your relationships with others?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think what would happen is that I would start to feel more comfortable with not knowing what's going to happen next, and I would be able to focus more on the present moment and the journey of the story, rather than worrying about the ending.

                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>As you continue to explore this connection between your need for control and your desire for control in your life, it's striking me that you're starting to recognize the ways in which this need is actually limiting your ability to fully engage with the world around you. By acknowledging and accepting the uncertainty that comes with reading, you're taking a step towards embracing the uncertainty that is inherent in all areas of life. This can be a scary but ultimately liberating experience.</div>

                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>As you're recognizing this connection between your need for control and your desire for control in your life, it's clear that this is a complex and deeply personal issue, Gerald. It's not just about the endings of books, but about how you approach uncertainty and unpredictability in all areas of your life. Research suggests that humans have a natural tendency to seek control and order, but it's also important to recognize that control is an illusion, and that uncertainty is a natural part of life. Can you help me understand what you think would happen if you were to start acknowledging and accepting the uncertainty that is inherent in all areas of life, rather than trying to control every outcome?</div>
