                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Hi Hunter, thanks for coming in today. How are you doing?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I’ve been feeling pretty down about my performance lately. It's like no matter how hard I try, I can't shake this feeling that I'm not good enough because I didn’t go to a top-tier school.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like the pressure to live up to certain expectations, particularly those surrounding your education, has been weighing heavily on you, and it's affecting your confidence and self-perception. Can you help me understand more about what you think would happen if you were to let go of the idea that your worth is defined solely by your academic accomplishments?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I don't know... I guess I would feel like I'm not as good as everyone else, like I'm somehow less of an athlete because I didn't attend a top-tier school. It's like, if I'm not the best in every way, then what's the point of even trying? But at the same time, I don't want to rely on just my athletic skills, I want to be well-rounded, you know?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're carrying a heavy burden of expectation, not just from others, but also from yourself, and that's causing a lot of inner conflict. Can you help me understand more about what you think would happen if you were to let go of the idea that your worth is directly tied to your athletic performance and academic background?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah, I can see that. It's like, I'm trying to prove myself to everyone, but also to myself, that I'm worthy of being a professional athlete. But, it's hard to shake off the feeling that I'm not good enough because of my education.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like this feeling of not being good enough because of your education has been a persistent nag in the back of your mind, and it's hard to imagine being able to silence that voice completely. Can you help me understand what you think would happen if you were able to find a way to quiet that voice, even just for a little while? How do you think it would affect your confidence and performance on the court?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think if I could quiet that voice, even for a little while, it would give me the space to focus on my skills and what I can control, rather than constantly worrying about what others think of me. But, it's scary to let go of that constant comparison and the pressure to be perfect. I worry that I'll lose my edge and become complacent if I'm not constantly striving to be the best.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>As you've shared, it seems like you're caught in a cycle of self-doubt and pressure to perform, which can be exhausting and draining. Can you tell me more about what you think would happen if you were to let go of the need to be perfect and focus on making progress rather than striving for perfection?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I'm starting to see that my worth isn't solely defined by my athletic performance or educational background. It's like, I can still be a great athlete even if I didn't attend a top-tier school. I don't have to constantly compare myself to others, and I can focus on my strengths and what I can control. It's a scary thought, but I think it could be liberating to let go of that pressure and just be myself.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>As you continue to explore this idea of embracing your strengths and worth, I'm wondering if there are any specific situations or moments in your life where you feel like you've been able to let go of that need to be perfect and just be yourself, even if it's just for a brief moment. What did that feel like, and how did it impact your experience?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>That's a great question. I think one time I felt like I was able to let go of that pressure was during a game where I had a great performance and my teammates were all congratulating me. It was like, for a moment, I forgot about all the comparisons and just felt like I was part of the team and we were all working together towards a common goal. It was a really empowering feeling, and it made me realize that my worth isn't solely defined by my athletic performance or educational background.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It's interesting that you mention feeling like you're still searching for a sense of belonging and identity, even after having had that empowering experience on the court. Can you help me understand what you think might be the connection between your sense of identity and your educational background, and how that might be impacting your feelings of belonging?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah, I think that experience on the court really showed me that my worth isn't solely defined by my athletic performance or educational background. It's like, I can still be a great athlete even if I didn't attend a top-tier school. I don't have to constantly compare myself to others, and I can focus on my strengths and what I can control. It's a scary thought, but I think it could be liberating to let go of that pressure and just be myself.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Building on that experience, it's clear that you've had moments where you've felt more grounded and confident in who you are, beyond your educational background. Can you help me understand what specifically about those moments feels different, and what you think might be the common thread that allowed you to feel more at peace with yourself?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think those moments are different because I'm able to focus on my strengths and what I can control, rather than constantly worrying about what others think of me. And I'm starting to realize that my worth isn't solely defined by my athletic performance or educational background, which is a huge relief.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>As you continue to explore these moments of confidence and self-acceptance, I want to acknowledge that it's not always easy to balance those feelings with the pressure to perform and meet expectations, especially in a high-achieving environment like professional athletics. Can you talk to me more about how you think about your sense of self-worth and identity when you're not having a great game or when you're facing setbacks?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah, I think when I'm not having a great game or when I'm facing setbacks, I tend to fall back into that old pattern of self-doubt and negative self-talk, where I start to question my worth as an athlete and as a person. It's like, I feel like I'm failing in some way, and that makes me feel like I'm not good enough. But at the same time, I know that those thoughts aren't necessarily true, and that I've had moments where I've felt more confident and grounded in who I am.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're still trying to reconcile the idea that your worth isn't solely defined by your educational background with the lingering feelings of self-doubt and inadequacy that can arise when you're not performing up to your own or others' expectations. Can you help me understand what you think would be the most helpful step for you to take when you start to feel that spiral of negative self-talk and self-doubt, to help ground yourself in a sense of self-worth that's not tied to your performance?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>It sounds like I've been stuck in this cycle of self-doubt and pressure to perform, and it's exhausting. I think what would be most helpful for me is to focus on my strengths and what I can control, rather than constantly comparing myself to others and worrying about what they think of me. If I can find a way to quiet that voice of self-doubt and focus on my own goals and values, I think I'll be able to find a sense of peace and confidence that isn't tied to my performance.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>As you continue to recognize the impact of those unhelpful thoughts on your self-perception and athletic performance, I encourage you to ask yourself what specific evidence you have for believing that your educational background defines your worth. What are the specific thoughts or experiences that have led you to this conclusion, and are there any alternative perspectives that you've overlooked or dismissed?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I've been beating myself up over this for too long, and I'm starting to realize that my worth isn't solely defined by my athletic performance or educational background. It's like, I can still be a great athlete even if I didn't attend a top-tier school. I don't have to constantly compare myself to others, and I can focus on my strengths and what I can control. It's a scary thought, but I think it could be liberating to let go of that pressure and just be myself.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>As you continue to explore this idea of embracing your strengths and worth, I'm curious to understand how you think your relationships with others might shift if you were to let go of the need to constantly prove yourself and focus on being true to yourself. Are there any specific relationships that you think would be impacted, and how do you think you would approach those relationships differently?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think if I were to stop constantly comparing myself to others and focus on my own strengths and what I can control, I would be able to build more authentic relationships with my teammates and coaches. Right now, I feel like I'm always trying to prove myself to them, and that's putting a lot of pressure on me. But if I can let go of that need to be perfect and just be myself, I think I would be able to connect with others on a deeper level and build stronger relationships.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>As you continue to explore this idea of embracing your strengths and worth, I'm curious to understand what specific situations or environments make it challenging for you to let go of the need to constantly prove yourself, and how you think you could start to reframe those situations to focus on being true to yourself.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I'm starting to see that my worth isn't solely defined by my athletic performance or educational background.

                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>As you've been reflecting on the idea that your worth isn't solely defined by your athletic performance or educational background, I'm noticing that you're starting to let go of some of that pressure and embracing your strengths. Can you help me understand what it is about your educational background that's been contributing to this feeling of not being good enough, and whether there's a specific scenario or experience that's been playing over and over in your mind?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think what's been bothering me the most is the constant comparison to my peers who attended top-tier schools. It's like, I feel like I'm always trying to live up to this image of what a good athlete should be, and that's putting a lot of pressure on me. But at the same time, I'm starting to realize that my worth isn't solely defined by my athletic performance or educational background. It's like, I can still be a great athlete even if I didn't attend a top-tier school. I don't have to constantly compare myself to others, and I can focus on my strengths and what I can control.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>As you continue to explore this idea of embracing your strengths and worth, it's interesting to me that you're starting to notice a sense of liberation from the need to constantly prove yourself. Can you help me understand what you think will be the most significant changes you'll experience as you continue to cultivate this sense of self-worth, and how you'll prioritize your own needs and desires in your relationships with others?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think I'm starting to understand that my worth isn't solely defined by my athletic performance or educational background.

                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>As you continue to recognize this connection between your educational background and your sense of self-worth, I want to acknowledge that it's not uncommon for people to struggle with feelings of inadequacy or inadequation when they don't meet certain expectations. In fact, research has shown that our brains are wired to respond to threats to our self-esteem by activating the same neural pathways that respond to physical threats, which can lead to a sense of danger or anxiety. By reframing your narrative and focusing on your strengths and worth, you're not only challenging those negative thoughts but also helping to rewire your brain to respond in a more adaptive way. How do you think that understanding this underlying biology might help you in your journey towards self-acceptance?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think that understanding this underlying biology could help me by giving me a sense of relief and understanding that my feelings of inadequacy are not just a personal failing, but rather a common and natural response to the pressure to meet certain expectations. It's like, I've been beating myself up over this for too long, and it's nice to know that I'm not alone in this struggle.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're starting to uncover some underlying patterns and biases that have been influencing your sense of self-worth, and that's a really important step in the process of building self-acceptance. Can you tell me more about what you think might happen if you were able to challenge those patterns and cultivate a more compassionate and realistic understanding of yourself?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think if I can challenge those patterns and cultivate a more compassionate and realistic understanding of myself, I'll be able to let go of the need to constantly prove myself and focus on being true to myself. I'll be able to build stronger relationships with my teammates and coaches, and I'll be able to perform at my best without feeling like I'm constantly under pressure to meet certain expectations. It's like, I'll be able to find a sense of peace and confidence that isn't tied to my performance, and that's a really liberating feeling.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>As you continue to explore this idea of embracing your strengths and worth, I'd like to ask you to take a step back and reflect on the language you use to describe yourself. Often, the words we choose to describe ourselves can either empower or disempower us. Can you help me understand how you think the language you use to describe yourself might be impacting your self-perception and confidence, and what small changes you might make to start reframing your self-talk in a more positive and empowering way?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I've been thinking a lot about my self-talk, and I realize that I often use words like not good enough or inadequate to describe myself. It's like, I'm constantly beating myself up over not meeting certain expectations. But as I've been reflecting on my worth and strengths, I've started to notice that those negative self-talk patterns are really holding me back. I think if I were to start reframing my self-talk in a more positive and empowering way, it could really help me build confidence and self-acceptance.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It's interesting that you bring up the idea of reframing your self-talk, because I think it's a crucial step in developing a more compassionate and realistic understanding of yourself. Can you help me understand what specific thoughts or phrases you think would be most beneficial to challenge or replace, and how you envision incorporating this new self-talk into your daily routine or pre-performance rituals?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think it's getting easier to recognize those negative self-talk patterns and challenge them.

                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>As you continue to explore this sense of self-acceptance and self-worth, I'd like to highlight that it's a process that takes time and patience. It's not about achieving some sort of perfection, but rather embracing your unique strengths and weaknesses. Can you help me understand what small, tangible steps you might take to start cultivating this sense of self-acceptance in your daily life, and how you might start to reframe your self-talk to align with this newfound understanding of yourself?</div>
