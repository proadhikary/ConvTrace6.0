                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Hi Barbara, welcome. How can I support you today?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I often find myself comparing my family situation to those with siblings, which intensifies these feelings of rejection. It's like a constant reminder that I missed out on something important.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like this longing for a sibling has been a persistent feeling for you, and it's possible that it's connected to a sense of not quite fitting in with societal expectations around family. Can you help me understand more about what you think you've missed out on, and how you think not having siblings has impacted your life so far?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>That's a great point, I never really thought about it that way. I think what I've missed out on is the bond and connection that siblings often share. I've always felt like I've had to learn how to interact with people on my own, and it's made me more reserved and hesitant to open up to others.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like having to rely more on yourself to build relationships has had a significant impact on your sense of connection and belonging. Can you tell me more about what you think is the most challenging part of navigating these relationships without the natural support of siblings, and how you've learned to cope with those feelings of isolation?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think what's most challenging is feeling like I'm always an outsider, even among my own family, because I'm the only child. It's like I'm this little island, disconnected from everyone else. And sometimes, I feel like my parents are too focused on themselves and their own relationships, so I've learned to rely on my own coping mechanisms to deal with those feelings of loneliness.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're carrying around a sense of disappointment and longing for a sense of belonging within your family, and that's really understandable. Can you help me understand what you think would make a difference for you in terms of feeling more seen and understood by your parents? Would it be having more open conversations with them, or perhaps having them acknowledge the impact of their relationships on you?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>That makes sense, I can see how my parents' relationships with each other could be contributing to my feelings of disconnection. I think what would make a difference for me is if they could acknowledge the impact their relationships have on me, even if it's just a simple acknowledgment that they know I'm feeling left out. It would mean that they're aware of my emotions and are willing to make an effort to include me in their conversations and interactions.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It's interesting to explore how your parents' relationships can influence your sense of belonging and connection within the family. Can you tell me more about what you think would happen if your parents were more emotionally expressive and responsive to your needs, and how that might impact your feelings of disconnection?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think if my parents were more emotionally expressive and responsive to my needs, it would make me feel seen and heard, like I'm not just an afterthought or an only child. They would be acknowledging my emotions and validating my experiences, which would help me feel more connected to them. It's not just about having siblings, but about feeling like I'm a priority to them and that they care about my well-being.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>As I listen to you, I'm struck by the depth of longing and yearning for connection and understanding with your parents. It's as if you're hoping they could be a source of emotional sustenance, a sense of belonging that's been missing for a while. Can you help me understand what it is about your parents' behavior or absence of behavior that's led you to feel so disconnected? Is it a specific incident, a pattern of behavior, or something more general that's leaving you feeling like you're not seen or heard?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think what's been really challenging for me is that my parents have always been very focused on their own relationships with each other, and sometimes it feels like I'm just an afterthought. They're always talking about their friends, their hobbies, and their interests, but they rarely ask me about mine. It's like they're not really interested in what I have to say or what I'm doing. And when they do ask, it's usually just a superficial question, like How was your day? without really listening to the answer. It's like they're just going through the motions of being parents without really being present in the moment.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It can be really tough to feel like you're not a priority to the people who are supposed to be there for you, and it's no wonder you're left feeling unheard and unseen. Can you help me understand what you think you would need from your parents in order to feel more seen and heard in their lives? For example, would you need them to make more time for you, or would you need them to show more genuine interest in your thoughts and feelings?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>That's a great point, I think what I would need from my parents is for them to show more genuine interest in my thoughts and feelings. I want them to ask me questions and really listen to the answers, not just go through the motions of asking how my day was. I want them to be present in the moment and acknowledge my emotions, even if it's just a simple acknowledgment. It would mean a lot to me if they could validate my experiences and make an effort to understand where I'm coming from.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It's no wonder that you've been feeling a sense of disconnection and longing, given the depth of your emotional needs and the ways in which they haven't been met by your parents. Can you tell me more about what you think would happen if you were to express these needs to them directly, without expectation of a specific response or outcome? How do you think you would feel in that moment, and what do you think would be the potential benefits or risks of doing so?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think that if I were to express my needs to my parents directly, I would feel a sense of relief and validation, knowing that I've finally acknowledged and communicated my feelings to them. The potential benefits would be that they would understand me better and make an effort to be more present and supportive in our interactions. However, the risks would be that they might not be receptive to my needs or might even dismiss them, which could lead to further feelings of disconnection and disappointment.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It's not uncommon for people to carry around these kinds of unmet emotional needs and desires for connection, especially when it comes to family relationships. Can you tell me more about what you think would happen if you were to express your needs directly to your parents, and what you might need from yourself to feel prepared for that conversation?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think what's been really challenging for me is that my parents have always been very focused on their own relationships with each other, and sometimes it feels like I'm just an afterthought.

                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>As I listen to your words, I'm struck by the sense of resilience and resourcefulness you've developed in navigating these complex family dynamics. It's clear that you've been doing your best to find ways to cope with the feelings of disconnection and longing. Can you help me understand what you think would happen if you were to take a step back and acknowledge your own emotional needs, rather than trying to meet them through your parents? How might that shift your perspective on your relationships with them, and what do you think are the potential benefits or risks of taking this approach?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>It's interesting that you bring up the idea of acknowledging my own emotional needs, because I think that's exactly what I need to do. I've been so focused on trying to get my parents to understand me that I haven't stopped to think about what I need from myself to feel fulfilled. I think that if I can focus on my own emotional well-being and learn to validate my own experiences, I might feel more empowered to express my needs to my parents in a way that's authentic and meaningful. Additionally, I think that acknowledging my own emotional needs could help me let go of some of the feelings of resentment and disappointment I've been carrying around, which could ultimately improve my relationships with my parents.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It's not uncommon for people to struggle with prioritizing their own emotional needs, especially when there's a strong sense of responsibility or obligation to others. Can you help me understand how you think your emotions have been affected by this sense of responsibility, and what you think would happen if you were to start prioritizing your own emotional well-being?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think I've been carrying around so much emotional baggage from trying to meet my parents' expectations and validate their relationships that I've forgotten to prioritize my own emotional well-being. It's like I've been so focused on trying to fix them that I've neglected my own needs. I'm excited to explore this idea of acknowledging my own emotional needs and learning to validate my own experiences. I think it could be a game-changer for me in terms of feeling more empowered and fulfilled in my relationships, not just with my parents but with others as well.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>As you've shared, it's clear that taking care of your emotional needs is a crucial step in finding a sense of balance and fulfillment. It sounds like you're already taking the first step by recognizing the importance of prioritizing your own emotional well-being. Can you help me understand what kind of emotional support systems or networks you have in place, or what kind of relationships or connections would be most helpful in allowing you to explore and affirm your own sense of self?</div>
