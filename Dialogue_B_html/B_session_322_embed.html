                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Hi Evelyn, I'm glad you could make it today. How are you feeling?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I'm just really struggling with managing my expectations. I love reading, but I get so disappointed when I can't finish a book as quickly as I want to.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It's common to feel this way when you're really into a book and you're not able to make progress at the pace you'd like. Can you tell me more about what you think would happen if you gave yourself permission to read at your own pace, without worrying about meeting any specific expectations?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think if I did that, I'd feel like I'm not really reading as much as I should be, and that I'm just wasting my time. But at the same time, the pressure to read quickly is really overwhelming, and it's making me dread reading altogether.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're caught in a bit of a dilemma, where your desire for control over your reading pace is at odds with your fear of not meeting your own expectations. Can you help me understand more about what's driving this need for control, and what you think would happen if you were to let go of those expectations and simply focus on enjoying the process of reading?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>That's a good point, I guess. I think the need for control comes from my nursing profession, where I'm always trying to manage my time and prioritize tasks effectively. It's like my brain is wired to want to be efficient and productive, and reading at my own pace seems counterintuitive to that. But at the same time, I don't want to lose the joy of reading, and I'm worried that if I'm too focused on speed, I'll miss out on the experience.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It's interesting that you're recognizing the potential conflict between your nursing background and your approach to reading. Can you tell me more about what you think would happen if you were to let go of that need for control and efficiency, and simply allow yourself to read at a pace that feels comfortable to you, without worrying about meeting any specific expectations?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>That's a tough one, because it's hard for me to imagine not being in control of my reading experience. But I think if I could let go of that need for control, I might be able to enjoy the process more and not feel so stressed out about not finishing the book quickly enough. It's funny, I never thought about how my nursing background was influencing my approach to reading, but now that you mention it, it makes sense. Maybe I'm just trying to apply the same efficiency and productivity principles to my reading, which isn't necessarily the best approach.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It's interesting to see how your nursing background is influencing your approach to reading, and how that's affecting your experience. It's almost as if you're trying to apply the same rules and expectations to your reading that you do to your work, which can be really limiting. Can you tell me more about what it's like when you're reading and you start to feel like you're not meeting your own expectations? Is there a particular thought or feeling that comes up for you in those moments?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah, it's like my brain is constantly reminding me that I'm not reading fast enough, and that thought just fills me with this sense of disappointment and frustration. It's like I'm stuck in this never-ending cycle of feeling like I'm not doing it right, and it's really draining my enthusiasm for reading.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It's fascinating to explore how your nursing background is influencing your approach to reading, and how that's affecting your overall experience. It's common for professionals to carry over their work habits into other areas of life, and it sounds like you're doing that with reading. Can you help me understand what you think would happen if you were to challenge those work habits and allow yourself to read at a pace that feels comfortable to you, without worrying about meeting specific expectations?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think if I were to let go of that need for control and efficiency, I might be able to enjoy the process more and not feel so stressed out about not finishing the book quickly enough.

                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It's remarkable how our professional lives can influence our personal pursuits, isn't it? It sounds like you're carrying over some of those same pressures and expectations from your nursing work into your reading, and that's making it feel more like a chore than a source of enjoyment. Can you help me understand what you think would happen if you were to create a clearer boundary between your work and personal life, and allow yourself to approach reading with a more relaxed and receptive mindset?</div>

It's almost as if you're trying to apply the same rules and expectations to your reading that you do to your work, which can be really limiting. Can you help me understand what you think would happen if you were to acknowledge and accept that it's okay to read at your own pace, without worrying about meeting specific expectations or applying the same level of control and efficiency that you do in your nursing work?</div>

                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It's striking how closely you're holding onto those same standards of productivity and efficiency in your reading, even when it's not necessarily serving you. Can you help me understand what you think would happen if you were to challenge those expectations and allow yourself to read in a way that feels more relaxed and enjoyable, rather than trying to control the experience?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think I've been so focused on trying to accomplish this perfect reading experience that I've forgotten how to just enjoy the process. If I let go of that need for control and efficiency, I might be able to appreciate the book for what it is, rather than trying to rush through it to meet some arbitrary deadline. It's like I'm trying to cram the experience into a specific box, and that's just not working for me.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're carrying over a lot of pressure from your nursing work into your reading, and that's making it feel more like a chore than a source of enjoyment. Can we explore what you think would happen if you were to set aside your nursing hat and approach reading with a more curious and open-minded attitude, rather than trying to control the experience?</div>

                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It's fascinating to see how your nursing background is influencing your approach to reading, and it's clear that you're carrying a significant amount of pressure with you. Can you help me understand what you think would happen if you were to acknowledge that it's okay to make mistakes or not understand everything in the book, and that it's okay to slow down and savor the experience?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think I've been so focused on trying to control every aspect of my reading experience that I've forgotten how to let go and just enjoy the process.

                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>As you've been reflecting on this, I want to acknowledge that it's not uncommon for individuals, especially those in high-stress professions like nursing, to carry over those pressures into other areas of their life. It's almost as if our brains are wired to respond to challenges in a similar way, whether it's in our work or personal pursuits. By recognizing this pattern, we can start to explore strategies to help you rewire that response and cultivate a more relaxed and open approach to reading.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think I'm starting to see that my nursing background is influencing my reading habits in a way that's not serving me. I'm so used to being efficient and productive in my work that I'm trying to apply those same principles to my reading, which is causing me a lot of stress and disappointment. If I could let go of that need for control and efficiency, I might be able to enjoy the process of reading more and not feel so overwhelmed by my own expectations.

                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It's interesting that you mention feeling like you're not giving yourself permission to make mistakes or not understand everything in the book. Can you help me understand what that's like for you when you do make a mistake or don't understand something? Is it a fleeting thought or does it linger and affect your overall reading experience? Additionally, I'd like to propose that we explore some strategies to help you cultivate a more relaxed approach to reading, such as setting aside specific times to read without worrying about finishing a certain number of pages or taking notes. What do you think about that?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think I'm really starting to see that my nursing background is influencing my reading habits in a way that's not serving me.

                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>As you continue to explore the connection between your nursing background and your approach to reading, I want to acknowledge that it takes a lot of courage to recognize and confront the ways in which your professional training has influenced your personal pursuits. It's as if you're acknowledging that your nursing hat has been a sort of lens through which you've been viewing your reading experience, and that's a really important insight to have. Can you help me understand what you think it would take for you to separate those two roles in your mind, and how you might begin to approaches reading with a sense of curiosity and openness, rather than control and efficiency?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think I'm really starting to understand how my nursing background is influencing my reading habits, and it's been helpful to recognize that. It's like I've been trying to apply the same efficiency and productivity principles to my reading that I do in my work, and that's causing me a lot of stress and disappointment.

                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It's fascinating to see how your nursing background has influenced your approach to reading, and you're already taking some brave steps towards recognizing and challenging those patterns. Can you tell me more about what you think it would mean to separate your nursing identity from your personal pursuits, like reading? How might you start to see yourself as a reader, rather than a nurse reading?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think it would mean acknowledging that I don't have to be in control of everything I do, including my reading. As a nurse, I'm used to being responsible for a patient's care, but with reading, I can just let go and enjoy the process. I don't need to rush through a book or worry about not understanding everything. I can just savor the experience and appreciate the story or ideas being presented. It's like I'm giving myself permission to relax and not be so rigid about my expectations.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>As you continue to explore this connection, I want to acknowledge that it's common for professionals to carry over their sense of responsibility and control into other areas of life, often as a way to maintain a sense of security and competence. However, it's also important to recognize that this can sometimes limit our ability to fully engage and enjoy our personal pursuits. Can you help me understand what you think would be the benefits of creating a clearer distinction between your nursing work and your personal life, and how you might start to cultivate a sense of permission to approach reading with a more relaxed and open-minded attitude?</div>

                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It's interesting that you mention feeling like you're trying to cram the experience into a specific box. Can you tell me more about what that feels like for you? Is it a sense of pressure, anxiety, or something else entirely?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think it's a mix of all those emotions. It feels like I'm constantly trying to meet some unspoken expectation, like I'm not good enough if I don't finish the book quickly enough. And it's not just about the speed, it's also about understanding everything. I feel like I need to be an expert on the subject matter, and that's just not possible. It's like I'm putting too much pressure on myself, and it's making me feel anxious and overwhelmed.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It's fascinating to see how your nursing background has influenced your approach to reading, and it's clear that you're carrying a significant amount of pressure with you. I'd like to build on our previous conversations by exploring the idea that this pressure might be rooted in your desire for control and perfection. Can you help me understand what you think would happen if you were to let go of that need for control and perfection, and simply allow yourself to read for the joy of it, without worrying about finishing a certain number of pages or meeting specific expectations?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think that would be incredibly liberating. If I could let go of the need to control and perfect my reading experience, I might be able to truly enjoy the process and appreciate the book for what it is. It's like I've been trying to force the experience into a certain mold, and that's just not working for me. By letting go of those expectations, I might be able to find a sense of freedom and relaxation in my reading.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It's amazing how our professional lives can influence our personal pursuits, and it seems like your nursing background has had a significant impact on your approach to reading. I'd love to explore this further and help you uncover some strategies to shift your perspective. Can you tell me more about what you think would happen if you were to approach reading with a sense of curiosity and openness, rather than control and efficiency? What would be the benefits of letting go of the pressure to meet specific expectations and simply allowing yourself to engage with the material?</div>

                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It's fascinating to explore the idea that your nursing background has influenced your approach to reading, and I'm curious to know more about what you think would happen if you were to set aside your nursing hat and simply approach reading with a sense of curiosity and openness, rather than control and efficiency.
