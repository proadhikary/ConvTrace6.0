                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Hi Derek, I'm glad you could join me today. What brings you here?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I've been feeling really guilty about not spending every moment preparing for college. It feels like I can't take a break without feeling stressed or exhausted.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It's not uncommon for students to feel overwhelmed by the pressure to perform well and meet their parents' expectations, especially during this transition to college. Can you help me better understand what you think your parents' expectations are of you, and how you're trying to meet those expectations?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Honestly, I think they expect me to be a top performer and make them proud. They've always been very supportive, but sometimes I feel like they're putting too much pressure on me. I'm trying to work hard and make good grades, but it's hard to keep up with the stress and anxiety.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It's understandable that you're feeling buried under the weight of those expectations, and it's no wonder you're experiencing stress and anxiety as a result. Can you tell me more about what you think would happen if you were to let your parents down, even just a little bit? What are some of the fears or worries that come up for you when you think about not meeting their expectations?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think they would be really disappointed and maybe even ashamed of me. They would probably tell me that I'm not living up to my potential and that I'm not good enough. It's hard for me to imagine them not being proud of me, and that thought alone keeps me up at night, worrying about whether I'm good enough.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It's no wonder that the weight of these expectations is taking a toll on your mental health, causing you to feel anxious and worried about not meeting your parents' expectations. Research has shown that when we're under pressure to perform, our brains can actually become less effective at performing well, a concept known as the oath overload effect. Have you heard of this before?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah, I've heard of it, but I never really thought about how it applies to me. It makes sense, though. I feel like I'm constantly trying to prove myself and meet these expectations, and it's exhausting. I'm starting to wonder if it's even worth it.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It's interesting that you bring up the idea of self-identity and feeling like you're constantly trying to prove yourself. Can you tell me more about what you think is at the root of this need to constantly prove yourself, and how you think it's impacting your sense of self-worth?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think it's because I've always been the good kid, the one who gets good grades and makes my parents proud. Maybe I'm trying to prove to myself that I'm worthy of their love and approval, even when they're not explicitly saying it. It's like I'm constantly seeking validation from them, and it's hard for me to stop because it's become such a big part of my identity.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>As you've been reflecting on this pattern, I want to acknowledge that it's not uncommon for people to tie their sense of self-worth to external validation, especially when they've been receiving it for a long time. It can be challenging to break free from that dynamic, but it's not impossible. Can you imagine what it would be like to start exploring what you want to achieve for yourself, rather than trying to meet your parents' expectations?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah, it's hard to imagine, but at the same time, it sounds kind of freeing. Like, I wouldn't have to carry around this weight of needing to be perfect all the time.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It's fascinating to see how this pattern has been going on for so long, and it's amazing that you're recognizing the impact it's having on your mental health. Research suggests that when we start to separate our self-worth from external validation, we can experience a significant reduction in stress and anxiety. Can you think of one small step you could take to start making progress towards embracing your own goals and desires, rather than trying to meet your parents' expectations?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>That's a good question. I think one small step I could take is to start setting some personal goals for myself, separate from what my parents want me to achieve. Like, maybe I could start a hobby or join a club on campus that has nothing to do with academics. That way, I can focus on something that brings me joy and fulfillment, rather than just trying to meet their expectations.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>I love how you're starting to envision a life where you can pursue your own interests and goals, rather than just trying to meet your parents' expectations. It's amazing how taking small steps towards autonomy can have a profound impact on our sense of self-worth and overall well-being. Can you tell me more about what you think would happen if you were to start making decisions that align with your own values and goals, even if they differ from your parents'? How do you think that would affect your relationship with them?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>It's scary to think about, but I think it would be liberating to make decisions that are truly mine, even if they don't align with my parents' expectations. I worry that they might be disappointed or even angry with me, but at the same time, I think it would be a huge relief to not have to constantly worry about what they think of me. I feel like I would be able to breathe a little easier and focus on what I want, rather than trying to meet their expectations.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>As you start to imagine what it would be like to make decisions that are true to yourself, it's natural to also wonder about the potential impact on your relationships with your parents. It's almost as if you're sensing that there's a tension between pleasing them and staying true to yourself. Can you help me understand what you think would happen if you were to start setting boundaries and prioritizing your own needs and desires, even if that means making choices that are different from what your parents want for you?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think setting boundaries and prioritizing my own needs might be scary for my parents at first, but ultimately, it could be a good thing for our relationship. It might force them to see me as an individual with my own goals and desires, rather than just as their child who's supposed to make them proud. Maybe they'll realize that I'm capable of making my own decisions and that their expectations aren't always what's best for me.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>As you start to imagine creating space between your own desires and your parents' expectations, I want to acknowledge that it can be scary to take small steps towards autonomy, especially when it's a new and unfamiliar territory for you. It's almost as if you're navigating through uncharted waters, and it's natural to feel uncertain about what lies ahead. Can you tell me more about what you think would happen if you were to take a small step towards asserting your independence, and what kind of support system do you think you might need to feel more comfortable with that?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>It's funny, I never thought about how my parents' expectations are linked to my sense of self-worth. I always just assumed that I was doing it for them, but now I'm starting to realize that I'm doing it for myself too, in a way. I think setting boundaries and prioritizing my own needs would be scary for my parents, but ultimately, it could be a good thing for our relationship. It might force them to see me as an individual with my own goals and desires, rather than just as their child who's supposed to make them proud.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>As you continue to explore this dynamic, I'm struck by how it seems to be a complex interplay between your desire to please your parents and your own need for self-validation. Can you tell me more about what you think would happen if you were to start setting boundaries and prioritizing your own needs, even if that means making choices that are different from what your parents want for you? How do you think that might impact your sense of self-worth and overall well-being?</div>

It's impressive that you're taking the first steps towards asserting your independence and prioritizing your own needs. Can you tell me more about what you think would happen if you were to start setting boundaries and communicating your needs more openly with your parents? How do you think that might shape your relationship with them and your own sense of autonomy?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I'm starting to realize that my parents' expectations have been controlling my life for so long, and I feel like I've lost myself in the process. I want to break free from this cycle and start making decisions that are true to who I am. I think setting boundaries and communicating my needs more openly with my parents will be a big step towards achieving that. It's scary to think about, but I know it's necessary if I want to live a life that's authentic and fulfilling.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>As you've recognized the impact of your parents' expectations on your sense of self-worth and autonomy, it's clear that you're taking a crucial step towards reclaiming your agency and living a life that's authentic to who you are. Can you tell me more about what you think it would mean to you to start making decisions that align with your own values and goals, even if they differ from your parents'? How do you envision this shift playing out in your daily life, and what kind of support system do you think you might need to make this transition smoother?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think what's holding me back from setting boundaries and prioritizing my own needs is the fear of disappointing my parents. I've always been the good kid, and the thought of going against their expectations is terrifying. But at the same time, I'm starting to realize that I've been living my life for their approval, and it's suffocating me. I want to break free from this cycle and start making decisions that are true to who I am.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're recognizing the importance of setting boundaries and prioritizing your own needs, but are still hesitant due to the fear of disappointing your parents. I want to acknowledge that it's a big step to take, but it's also possible that your parents may be more understanding and supportive than you think. Can you imagine what would happen if you were to have an open and honest conversation with them about your needs and desires, and how you think they might respond?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think it would be really tough to have that conversation with my parents, but at the same time, I can see how it would be necessary for me to move forward. I've always been afraid of disappointing them, but I'm starting to realize that their expectations are suffocating me and not allowing me to be my true self. I think if I could somehow communicate to them that I'm not doing this for them, but for myself, they might understand and support me more than I think. It's scary to think about, but I know it's something I need to do if I want to break free from this cycle and start living a life that's authentic and fulfilling.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're already taking a huge step by acknowledging the impact of your parents' expectations on your sense of self-worth, and recognizing that you want to start making decisions that align with your own values and goals. That takes a lot of courage. It's also interesting that you're thinking about how your parents might respond to you setting boundaries and prioritizing your own needs. Research has shown that when we express our needs and desires assertively, but respectfully, it can actually lead to stronger and more authentic relationships. Can you help me understand what you think would happen if you were to have this conversation with your parents, and how you envision it playing out?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think that conversation would be really tough, but at the same time, I can see how it would be necessary for me to move forward.

                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It's clear that you're at a crossroads, trying to balance your own desires with your parents' expectations. What I want to acknowledge is that it's not uncommon for individuals to struggle with this dynamic, especially when it comes to family relationships. In fact, research has shown that setting healthy boundaries and asserting one's own needs is a crucial step in developing emotional autonomy and self-worth. Can you help me understand what you think would happen if you were to prioritize your own needs and desires, even if that means having a difficult conversation with your parents?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think that's a good question. I've been so focused on trying to meet my parents' expectations that I haven't really thought about what I want for myself. But the more I reflect on it, the more I realize that I've been living my life for them, not for me. I think if I were to start prioritizing my own needs and desires, it would be a huge step towards autonomy and self-worth. It would mean that I'm making decisions that align with my own values and goals, rather than trying to meet someone else's expectations.

It's like I've been carrying around this weight of trying to meet everyone else's expectations, and it's exhausting. If I could start making decisions that align with my own values and goals, I think it would give me a sense of autonomy and self-worth that I've been lacking. It would mean that I'm taking control of my life and not letting others dictate my choices. I'm scared of the conversation with my parents, but I know it's necessary if I want to break free from this cycle and start living a life that's authentic and fulfilling.</div>
