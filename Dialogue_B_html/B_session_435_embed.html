                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Hi Justin, thanks for coming in today. What brings you to counseling?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I've been feeling a lot of distress at work lately. I believe my boss doesn't like me, and it's really affecting my performance and well-being.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Can you help me understand what you mean by thinking your boss doesn't like you? Is it something specific that's happened between the two of you, or is it more of a general feeling you've been getting from interacting with him?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>That's a great question. I think it's a combination of both. It started a few months ago when I received some constructive criticism from my boss. I felt like he was being overly critical, and it made me doubt my abilities. Since then, I've been overthinking every interaction we have, wondering if he's looking down on me or if I've done something wrong. It's like I'm constantly waiting for the other shoe to drop, and it's exhausting.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're carrying around a lot of self-doubt and anxiety, and your interactions with your boss are definitely contributing to that. It's understandable that you're worried about making mistakes and not meeting his expectations, especially given the high-stress environment of a veterinary clinic. Can you tell me more about what you think would happen if you were to make a mistake or not meet his expectations? What are some of the catastrophic thoughts that come up for you in those moments?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>That's a great question. I think when I make a mistake, I worry that my boss will think I'm incompetent and that I'll get fired. I also worry that he'll tell my husband about my mistake and that my husband will be disappointed in me. It's like I'm catastrophizing the situation and assuming the worst-case scenario.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're experiencing a common phenomenon called the amplification effect, where your brain takes a perceived threat or mistake and blows it out of proportion, leading to increased anxiety and worry. Can you help me understand what you think drives this amplification effect in your case? Is it a fear of not meeting your own high standards, or something else entirely?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>That makes sense, I think it's a combination of both. I've always been a perfectionist, and I put a lot of pressure on myself to perform well. But I also think it's because I'm worried that if I make a mistake, it will reflect poorly on my husband and family. I feel like I'm carrying the weight of their expectations on my shoulders, and it's a heavy burden to bear.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It's not uncommon for people to take on a significant amount of responsibility, especially when it comes to their family's well-being. Can you help me understand what you think would happen if you were to let go of some of that pressure and just focus on being present in the moment, rather than worrying about making mistakes or meeting others' expectations?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>That's a great question. I think if I could let go of the pressure to be perfect and focus on being present in the moment, I would feel a sense of relief and freedom. I would be able to approach my work with a more positive attitude and be more open to learning from my mistakes.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>I love how you're starting to recognize the toll that perfectionism is taking on your daily life. It's amazing how much our quest for perfection can become a heavy burden, isn't it? Can you tell me more about what you think would happen if you were to start practicing self-compassion and acceptance, especially when things don't go exactly as planned?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>That's a great point, and I think I've been so focused on trying to be perfect that I've forgotten how to be kind to myself. When I think about it, I realize that I'm not just trying to impress my boss, but also my husband and family. I'm putting so much pressure on myself to be perfect because I feel like I'm representing them, and if I fail, I'll let them down. But what if I just accepted myself and my mistakes, and didn't make them mean so much? What if I could say to myself, Hey, I made a mistake, but that's okay, I'll learn from it and move on?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It's interesting that you mention representing your family and feeling like you'd be letting them down if you weren't perfect. Can you help me understand what you think would happen if you were to have a conversation with your husband and family about how you're feeling, and what you think they would say if you were to express your concerns to them? Would you be surprised to find that they're not as focused on perfection as you are, and that they just want you to be happy and fulfilled in your own skin?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think that would be a huge relief to have that conversation with them. I've been carrying around this burden of being perfect for so long, and it's exhausting. I'm sure they would be surprised to hear how much pressure I'm putting on myself and how it's affecting my daily life. I think they would be understanding and supportive, and they would remind me that I'm not just a representative of them, but also a person with my own strengths and weaknesses.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It's interesting that you mention feeling like you need to be perfect to be loved and accepted, and that this pressure is coming from both within and without. Can you help me understand what you think would happen if you were to start setting some boundaries with others, and prioritizing your own needs and desires over the need to be perfect?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think setting boundaries would help me feel more in control of my life and reduce the pressure to be perfect. By prioritizing my own needs and desires, I would be able to focus on what's truly important to me, rather than trying to meet everyone else's expectations.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It's fascinating to see how this pattern of perfectionism and self-doubt has been playing out in your life, and how it's affecting your relationships and overall well-being. Can you help me understand what you think would happen if you were to start practicing self-compassion and acceptance, especially when things don't go exactly as planned? How do you think that might shift your relationships with your husband and family, and what kind of impact do you think it could have on your sense of self-worth and confidence?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think practicing self-compassion and acceptance would allow me to develop a more realistic understanding of myself and my capabilities. I would be able to acknowledge that I'm not perfect and that it's okay to make mistakes. This would help me let go of the need to impress others and focus on being present in the moment. I would also be able to communicate more effectively with my husband and family, as I would no longer be carrying around the burden of needing to be perfect. They would likely respond with understanding and support, and I would feel more confident in my relationships and my own abilities.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're recognizing that perfectionism has been a driving force in your life, and that it's been influencing your relationships and sense of self-worth. It's common for people to feel overwhelmed by the pressure to be perfect, especially when it's fueled by both internal and external expectations. Can you help me understand what you think would happen if you were to start acknowledging and accepting your imperfections, rather than trying to hide them behind a mask of perfection?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think acknowledging and accepting my imperfections would be a huge relief.

How do you think that would affect your relationships and overall sense of self-worth?</div>

                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Thank you for helping me see the connection between my perfectionism and self-doubt.
