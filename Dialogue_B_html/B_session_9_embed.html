                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Hi Jennifer, I'm glad you decided to come in today. How are you feeling?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Iâ€™ve been really stressed and feeling completely inadequate at my job.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Can you help me understand how you're experiencing this feeling of incompetence? Is it as if you're having a constant inner dialogue, second-guessing yourself, or are you noticing specific patterns or behaviors in your work that are making you feel uncertain?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>It's like I'm constantly replaying that incident in my head, reliving the moment when the dog didn't survive. It's like I'm stuck in this never-ending loop of self-blame and regret. I just can't shake the feeling that I'm not good enough, that I'm a failure as a veterinarian.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It's interesting that you mention feeling like you're not good enough as a veterinarian, and that this experience has really shaken your confidence. Can you help me understand what you mean by not good enough? Is it about meeting the high standards of veterinary care, or is it something more personal, like feeling like you're not living up to your own expectations?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>That's a good question. I think it's a combination of both. As a veterinarian, I strive to provide the best care possible for my patients, and I know that I'm not perfect. But, on a deeper level, I think it's about feeling like I'm not good enough as a person. Like, I'm supposed to be this confident, capable, and compassionate person, but in that moment, I felt like I failed in all those areas.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It's not uncommon for a traumatic event like this to have a ripple effect on our sense of self, and it sounds like you're struggling to reconcile the expectations of others with your own self-perception. Can you help me understand what you think it would take to move beyond this sense of self-blame and regret, and what small steps you could take to start rebuilding your confidence as a veterinarian and as a person?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I don't know, I just feel like I'll never be able to shake this feeling off. It's like, no matter what I do, I'll always be haunted by the memory of that dog. And I don't know how to move forward from here. I feel like I'm stuck in this perpetual state of self-doubt and regret.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like the weight of self-blame and regret is still very much present for you, and it's understandable that you're struggling to find a way to release it. Can you tell me more about what you mean by finding a way out of this dark place? What does that look like to you, and what are you hoping to achieve by moving forward? Additionally, I'd like to share that our brains are wired to remember traumatic events in vivid detail, and this is a natural response to help us avoid similar situations in the future. However, this can also lead to a pattern of rumination, where we get stuck replaying the event over and over in our minds.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I don't know, I just feel like I'll never be able to shake this feeling off.

I feel like I'm stuck in this perpetual state of self-doubt and regret.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're carrying a heavy burden of guilt and regret, and it's affecting your daily life and relationships. I want to acknowledge that it takes a lot of courage to confront these feelings, and it's natural to wonder if you'll ever be able to shake them off.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I don't know, I just feel like I'll never be able to shake this feeling off. It's like, no matter what I do, I'll always be haunted by the memory of that dog.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like the weight of this experience is really getting to you, and it's understandable that you're struggling to reconcile the expectations of others with your own self-perception. It's almost as if you're stuck in a cycle of self-blame and regret, replaying the event over and over in your mind. Research has shown that this kind of mental replay can be a common reaction to traumatic events, and it's a sign that your brain is trying to make sense of what happened.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I don't know, I just feel like I'll never be able to shake this feeling off. It's like, no matter what I do, I'll always be haunted by the memory of that dog. And I don't know how to move forward from here. I feel like I'm stuck in this perpetual state of self-doubt and regret.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It's remarkable how entrenched this pain and regret have become in your daily experience, and I want to acknowledge that it's not surprising given the traumatic nature of the event. Research suggests that our brains can get stuck in patterns of rumination, making it challenging to break free from the cycle of guilt and regret. Would you be willing to explore some mindfulness exercises to help you stay present and focused on the here and now, rather than getting caught up in thoughts about the past?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I understand what you're saying, but it's hard for me to imagine a future where I'm not haunted by this memory. It's like, the more I try to move forward, the more I feel like I'm running away from it, and that's not what I want. I want to be able to acknowledge what happened and learn from it, but I don't know how to do that without getting stuck in this cycle of self-blame and regret.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>I can sense how heavy this experience has been for you, and it's no wonder that you're struggling to move forward. It's as though you're carrying this burden of guilt and regret, and it's affecting your daily life and relationships. I'd like to explore this idea of reframing your experience with you. What if, instead of seeing the memory of the dog as something to be overcome, you could see it as a reminder of your capacity to care and compassionately help others, even in the face of uncertainty and adversity? How might that change your perspective on the situation?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I don't know, it's hard for me to imagine a future where I'm not haunted by this memory. It's like, the more I try to move forward, the more I feel like I'm running away from it, and that's not what I want.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>As I listen to your story, I'm struck by the complexity of the emotions you're experiencing. It sounds like your sense of identity as a veterinarian is deeply entwined with the trauma of that experience, and it's affecting your ability to move forward. I want to acknowledge that it's normal to feel stuck in this cycle of self-blame and regret, and that it's not uncommon for professionals in the field to struggle with these feelings after a difficult case. Additionally, our brains can get stuck on the negative aspects of traumatic events, making it hard to separate facts from emotions. Would you like to explore some strategies to help you begin to reframe your experience and see it as a reminder of your capacity to care and compassionately help others?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I'm not sure how to even begin to reframe this experience. It's like, no matter how hard I try to focus on the positive aspects of my work, I keep getting pulled back to that moment when the dog didn't survive. It's like, my brain just won't let me move on from it.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>As I hear you talk about the memory of the dog's passing, it's clear that it's still a very raw and emotional experience for you. It's no wonder that you're struggling to move forward from it. I want to acknowledge that reframing your perspective is a process that takes time and effort, but it might be helpful to start by identifying small moments of success and compassion in your work as a veterinarian since the traumatic event. Can you think of any instances where you've helped an animal or a client in a meaningful way, and how those experiences have made you feel?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I'm not sure how to even begin to reframe this experience.

                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>As you've shared, it's clear that the memory of that dog's passing has become deeply intertwined with your sense of identity as a veterinarian. It's common for traumatic experiences to have a profound impact on our sense of self, and it's a testament to your compassion and empathy that this experience has had such a lasting effect on you. I'm wondering, what do you think would happen if you were to approach this memory with a sense of curiosity, rather than guilt or regret? Would you be willing to explore what lessons you might have learned from this experience, or what wisdom you might have gained from the time you spent with that dog?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I'm not sure how to approach this memory with curiosity. It feels like it's so deeply ingrained in my emotions and thoughts that I'm not sure I can separate myself from it.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>As you explore the idea of approaching this memory with curiosity, I want to gently remind you that it's not about erasing or dismissing the pain and difficulty you experienced, but rather about creating some space to understand and learn from it.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I'm starting to feel overwhelmed again, like I'm stuck in this never-ending cycle of self-blame and regret. I don't know how to move forward from here, and I'm starting to wonder if I'll ever be able to shake this feeling off. It's like, no matter what I do, I'll always be haunted by the memory of that dog.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It's interesting that you mention replaying the event in your mind, as research suggests that this can be a common way for our brains to process traumatic experiences. Can you tell me more about what you think you might be trying to achieve by replaying this event, and how you think it might be contributing to your feelings of self-blame and regret?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I just feel like I'm stuck in this perpetual state of self-doubt and regret. I thought I was doing the right thing, but now I'm just consumed by this feeling that I'm not good enough. I don't know how to get out of this darkness, and it's eating away at me.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>As you reflect on those moments of success and compassion in your work, can you think of any commonalities or patterns that emerge, perhaps indicating that your capacity for empathy and care is stronger than you might be giving yourself credit for?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I'm still struggling to see how I can move forward from this experience.

I feel like I'm stuck in this perpetual state of self-doubt and regret, and I don't know how to shake it off.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>As you continue to reflect on this experience, can you help me understand how you think your perception of yourself as a veterinarian has changed since this event occurred? Are there any moments or interactions with your animals that still feel tinged with guilt or regret, and if so, what are some of the thoughts or emotions that arise when you're in those situations?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I don't know, it feels like I'm just stuck in this never-ending cycle of self-blame and regret. I don't know how to move forward from here.</div>

It seems like this experience has become a kind of emotional anchor, holding you back from fully embracing your skills and abilities as a caregiver. Can you help me understand what you think would happen if you were able to gently untangle this emotional knot and begin to see yourself as more than just the sum of this one event?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I don't know, I just feel like I'll never be able to shake this feeling off. It's like, no matter what I do, I'll always be haunted by the memory of that dog.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>As you've shared with me, it's as if this memory has become a constant reminder of your vulnerability and the fear of not being able to live up to others' expectations. I'd like to explore with you how this experience has influenced your perception of yourself as a veterinarian, and how it's been affecting your daily interactions with animals and clients. By examining the ways in which this memory has become entrenched in your mind, we can work together to develop strategies to reframe it and reclaim your confidence as a compassionate and skilled caregiver.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I feel like I've been stuck in this perpetual state of self-doubt and regret for so long, and I don't know how to move forward from here.

                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>What I hear you saying, Jennifer, is that you're feeling stuck and uncertain about how to move forward with your work as a veterinarian while still carrying the emotional weight of that experience. It's as if you're caught between your sense of duty and responsibility as a caregiver, and the feelings of guilt and regret that continue to plague you. Can you help me understand what you think would happen if you were to recognize that it's okay to acknowledge and process your emotions, rather than trying to suppress them or pretend they're not there? How might that allow you to begin to reframe your experience and see it as an opportunity for growth and learning, rather than a source of ongoing pain and regret?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I don't know, it feels like I'm just stuck in this never-ending cycle of self-blame and regret.

                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It seems that this experience has left a profound impact on your sense of identity and self-worth, and it's understandable that you're struggling to reconcile your sense of guilt and regret with your skills and abilities as a veterinarian. The research on trauma and its effects on the brain suggests that it's possible to rewire our thinking and begin to see this experience as an opportunity for growth and learning, rather than a source of shame and regret. Would you be open to exploring some strategies to help you reframe this experience and tap into the wisdom and compassion you've developed as a result of your work with animals?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I understand what you're saying, but it's really hard for me to imagine a future where I'm not haunted by this memory.

                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It's common to experience a mix of emotions when reflecting on a difficult experience like this, and it's not uncommon for guilt and regret to become overwhelming. In fact, research has shown that rumination, or replaying negative thoughts and emotions over and over, can actually reinforce those emotions and make it harder to move forward. Would you like to explore some strategies for reframing your experience and learning to live with the emotions that come with it, rather than trying to force them away?</div>
