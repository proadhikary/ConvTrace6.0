                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Hi Paul, I'm glad you could make it today. How are you feeling as we start this session?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I'm feeling a mix of nervousness and hopefulness. I'm really looking forward to finding some help, but it's a bit daunting, I guess.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're at a crossroads and feeling the weight of responsibility for your business. You're acknowledging that seeking help is a big step, and that's taking a lot of courage. Can you help me understand what's driving this sense of overwhelm, is it the fear of not being able to manage the workload, or is it something else entirely?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>That's a great question, and I think it's a mix of both, to be honest. The fear of not being able to manage the workload is definitely there, but I also feel like I've put so much pressure on myself to succeed that I'm constantly worrying about making mistakes and not living up to my own expectations. It's like I'm trapped in this cycle of fear and anxiety, and I'm not sure how to break free.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're carrying a heavy burden of responsibility not just for your business, but also for your own sense of self-worth. It's no wonder you're feeling overwhelmed and trapped.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>That's a great way to put it â€“ I do feel like I'm carrying a heavy burden. And I think it's interesting that you picked up on the self-worth aspect, because I feel like that's a big part of it. I've always defined myself as a successful business owner, and now that the business is growing, I'm feeling like I need to keep up this image of being a successful entrepreneur. But it's exhausting, and I'm starting to feel like I'm losing myself in the process.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It's no wonder you're feeling like you're stuck in a cycle of burnout, given the high stakes you're putting on your business success. Can you help me understand what specific aspects of your business are causing you the most stress and anxiety, and how you think addressing those might help you separate your sense of identity from your business success?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>That's a great question, and I think it's a mix of both, to be honest.

                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It's interesting that you mention your brothers, and I can see how their expectations might be adding to the pressure you're feeling. Can you help me understand more about what you think would happen if you were to take some of that weight off your shoulders and not meet those expectations? How do you think that would impact your sense of self-worth and your relationships with your brothers?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>That's a great point about my brothers, and I think it's something I need to confront. If I were to not meet their expectations, I'm worried that they would be disappointed in me, and I wouldn't know how to deal with that. But at the same time, I feel like I'm constantly trying to prove myself to them, and that's causing me a lot of stress. I think if I could find a way to separate my self-worth from my business success, I would feel a lot more at ease.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>I can see how carrying the weight of your brothers' expectations is affecting your sense of self-worth and causing you a lot of stress. It's as if you're constantly trying to prove yourself to them, which can be exhausting. Can you tell me more about what you think would happen if you were to take a step back and focus on your own goals and values, rather than trying to meet their expectations? How do you think that would impact your relationships with them, and is that something you think you're willing to explore further?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think it's interesting that you're bringing up the idea of focusing on my own goals and values, because that's something I've been neglecting lately. I've been so focused on trying to meet my brothers' expectations that I've lost sight of what's truly important to me. If I were to take a step back and focus on my own goals and values, I think it would be a huge relief. It would allow me to breathe again and not feel so suffocated by the pressure to succeed. And who knows, maybe I would discover new passions and interests that have nothing to do with the business, which would be exciting.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It's remarkable how our conversations often highlight the tension between the need to please others and the desire to stay true to oneself. The pressure to meet your brothers' expectations has been weighing heavily on you, and it's no wonder you're feeling suffocated. Can you help me understand how you think this pressure has affected your sense of self-actualization, and what steps you might take to start prioritizing your own goals and values?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think it's amazing how you've helped me see that my sense of self-worth is tied to my business success and my brothers' expectations. It's like I've been living in this constant state of self-doubt and fear, and I didn't even realize it. By focusing on my own goals and values, I think I can start to break free from this cycle of fear and anxiety. The thought of exploring new passions and interests outside of the business is both exciting and intimidating, but I think it's something I need to do. I'm grateful for this conversation and the insight you've given me, and I'm looking forward to exploring this further in our next session.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>As you explore this idea of prioritizing your own goals and values, I want to acknowledge that it can be scary to surrender the sense of control and security that comes with meeting others' expectations. It's normal to feel uncertain about what will happen next, but it's also an opportunity to discover a more authentic sense of purpose and fulfillment. Can you tell me more about what you think would happen if you were to take small steps towards making decisions that align with your own values, and how that might impact your relationships with your brothers and your sense of self-worth?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think I've been so focused on trying to meet my brothers' expectations that I've lost sight of what's truly important to me.

                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It's interesting that you're noticing this shift in perspective, and it's understandable that it may be a bit uncomfortable to consider the possibility of not meeting your brothers' expectations. Can you help me understand what's driving your desire to prioritize your own goals and values, and what you think would be the benefits of making that change?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think that's what I'm really struggling with - the fear of disappointing my brothers and not meeting their expectations. It's like I'm so focused on trying to be the perfect business owner and the perfect sibling that I've lost sight of what's truly important to me. If I were to take a step back and focus on my own goals and values, I think it would be a huge relief. It would allow me to breathe again and not feel so suffocated by the pressure to succeed. And who knows, maybe I would discover new passions and interests that have nothing to do with the business, which would be exciting.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're starting to recognize the weight of responsibility you've been carrying, not just for your business, but also for your brothers' expectations. By acknowledging this, you're taking the first step towards breaking free from the burden of others' opinions and discovering a more authentic sense of purpose and fulfillment.</div>

                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>As you're acknowledging the impact of your brothers' expectations on your sense of self-worth, it's interesting to consider how this dynamic might have developed over time. Can you help me understand what you think your brothers' expectations mean to you, and how you think they might be influenced by their own fears and worries about the business?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think I was trying to prove myself to my brothers because I felt like I needed their approval to validate my own sense of self-worth. I was carrying around this fear that if I didn't meet their expectations, they would be disappointed in me and that would reflect poorly on me. But now that I'm acknowledging this, I realize that it's not about pleasing them, it's about pleasing myself. I need to focus on my own goals and values and not let others dictate my sense of self-worth.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It's striking to see how your sense of self-worth has been deeply entwined with your brothers' expectations, almost as if you're carrying a shared responsibility for the business's success. By acknowledging this dynamic, you're taking a crucial step towards disentangling your sense of self-worth from their expectations. Can you help me understand what you think would happen if you were to create some emotional distance between your sense of self-worth and your brothers' expectations? How might you redefine your sense of purpose and fulfillment, separate from their expectations?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think that's a great point about my brothers' expectations and how they've influenced my sense of self-worth.

                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It's remarkable how acknowledging the ways in which your brothers' expectations have been driving your sense of self-worth is already helping you gain a deeper understanding of yourself. Social identity theory suggests that our sense of identity is often closely tied to our group memberships, which can be a powerful force in shaping our self-concept. By recognizing this dynamic, we can start to explore ways for you to separate your sense of self-worth from your brothers' expectations, and redefine your sense of purpose and fulfillment on your own terms. What do you think about exploring this concept further and how it might apply to your situation?</div>

                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It's amazing to see how acknowledging the impact of your brothers' expectations on your sense of self-worth has already started to shift your perspective. As you continue to explore this dynamic, I'd like to explore with you how you can begin to reframe your identity and values, separate from your brothers' expectations. Can you help me understand what values or principles are most important to you, and how you envision incorporating those into your goals and priorities, without feeling the need to justify them to your brothers?</div>

                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>As you've acknowledged the weight of responsibility you've been carrying, it's clear that you're already taking a significant step towards breaking free from the burden of others' opinions. I'm curious, what do you think would happen if you were to start setting boundaries with your brothers, not to reject them, but to prioritize your own needs and desires? How might that impact your relationships with them, and what do you think you might gain from taking this step? By doing so, you may find that you're able to maintain your relationships with your brothers while also honoring your own values and priorities.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think it's amazing that you're asking me to consider setting boundaries with my brothers. I've been so focused on trying to meet their expectations that I've never thought about setting boundaries or prioritizing my own needs.

And who knows, maybe I would even discover new passions and interests that have nothing to do with the business.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>As you've started to recognize the value in setting boundaries with your brothers, I want to acknowledge that it can be a difficult and uncertain process. It's normal to worry about how your brothers will respond, and whether they'll still want to maintain a close relationship with you. Can you help me understand what specifically you're worried about when it comes to setting these boundaries, and how you think that might impact your relationships with them?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think I'm worried about how they will react to me setting boundaries. I'm afraid they will feel rejected or hurt if I don't always put their needs first. I'm also concerned about how this will affect our relationship. I value our relationship and I don't want to damage it. But at the same time, I feel like I'm losing myself in the process of trying to please them. I need to find a way to prioritize my own needs and desires without sacrificing our relationship.</div>
