                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Hello Michael, it's nice to meet you. How are you feeling today?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I've been feeling pretty down since my trip to Frankfurt. It was just so stressful with the cramped plane rides, overpriced food, and no wifi. It's like all I can remember are the negatives, and it's really getting to me.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It's interesting that you mention feeling stuck in a rut, and I'm curious, what are some of the thoughts that have been going through your mind since you got back from Frankfurt? Have you noticed any patterns or themes in those thoughts that might be contributing to this feeling of being stuck?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah, I've been thinking a lot about how I always focus on the negative aspects of situations and how that's really affecting my mood. I feel like I'm stuck in this rut and can't seem to get out of it.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It's not uncommon for the negative feelings from a challenging experience like your trip to Frankfurt to linger, and it sounds like you're recognizing the impact it's having on your mood. Can you tell me more about what you're hoping to achieve or change about your current situation, and what steps you think you might need to take to get there?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Client:</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Can you tell me more about what you mean by stuck in a pattern of focusing on the negative aspects of situations? What are some specific thoughts or feelings that come up for you when you're replaying those frustrating moments from your trip?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think what's frustrating is that I can't seem to shake off these negative thoughts. Every time I think about the trip, I just get stuck on the bad experiences and it's like I'm reliving them all over again. It's exhausting.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It's not uncommon for traumatic or overwhelming experiences to get stuck in our minds, replaying like a broken record. It sounds like the memories of your trip to Frankfurt have become really intense and vivid for you, and it's like you're reliving those frustrating moments over and over again. Can you help me understand what specifically about those bad experiences is causing you to relive them, and what you think might need to shift in order for you to move on from this experience?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think the worst part is that I'm so used to focusing on the negative aspects that it's hard for me to even imagine seeing the good in things. It's like my brain is stuck in this negative loop, and I don't know how to break free from it.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>I can understand why you'd feel stuck in this pattern of negative thinking, especially after going through a traumatic experience like your trip to Frankfurt. It's not uncommon for people to get stuck in this kind of thinking, and it's actually a normal response to trauma. However, I'd like to explore some strategies with you to help you break free from this pattern and start seeing things from a more positive perspective. Can you tell me what you think would be the most helpful step for you to take in this process?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I'm not sure, I just feel like I'm stuck and I don't know how to get out of this negative thinking pattern. It's like it's taken over my brain and I can't shut it off.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're experiencing a lot of emotional distress and difficulty moving on from your trip to Frankfurt. It's normal to feel this way, especially after going through a stressful and traumatic experience like your trip. Can you help me understand what it's like for you when you're in the midst of this negative thinking pattern? How does your body respond, and what emotions do you experience when you're reliving those frustrating moments from your trip?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think it's really hard for me to imagine anything good coming out of this experience because it's so overwhelming and stressful. Every time I think about the trip, I feel like I'm right back there, reliving all the negative experiences. It's exhausting and it's hard for me to see a way out of this pattern of negative thinking.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It's interesting that you mention feeling stuck in this negative thinking pattern, and it's not uncommon for people to get caught up in replaying negative experiences over and over in their minds. Can you help me understand what you think might be the underlying message or lesson that your brain is trying to convey by keeping you stuck in this pattern? Is there something specific that you think you're supposed to learn or accomplish by dwelling on these negative experiences?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah, it's like my brain is stuck on replaying those negative experiences, and I don't know how to shut it off. It's exhausting and it's hard for me to imagine anything good coming out of this experience.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It's normal for our brains to get stuck on certain experiences, especially those that were traumatic or overwhelming, and it sounds like that's what's happening here. Can you help me understand what you think would happen if you were to approach this experience from a different perspective, one that focuses on what you learned or what went well, rather than what went wrong?</div>

                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're really struggling to break free from the emotional residue of your trip to Frankfurt, and it's understandable that you're feeling stuck and overwhelmed. Our brains are wired to focus on negative experiences because it helps us learn and adapt, but it's also important to recognize that this focus can become a pattern that's hard to break. Can you help me understand what you think would happen if you were to try to reframe your experience, not by erasing the negative emotions, but by acknowledging them and finding ways to integrate the lessons you learned into your daily life?</div>

                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It's interesting that you mention replaying those moments over and over in your mind, as our brains are wired to focus on negative experiences as a way of processing and learning from them. Can you help me understand what you think would happen if you were to challenge this pattern of negative thinking by intentionally focusing on small, positive aspects of the trip, rather than trying to push the negative emotions away? This might help your brain to start moving out of that stuck loop and find a new way of processing the experience.</div>

                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It's fascinating how our brains can get stuck replaying negative experiences, and it's almost as if they're trying to make sense of what happened. Can you help me understand what you think is driving this sense of overwhelm and stuckness, and if you think it's connected to your fear of not being able to learn from the experience or move forward in a positive way?</div>
