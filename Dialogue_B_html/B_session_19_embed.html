                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Hi David, Iâ€™m glad you reached out for support. How are you feeling today?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I've been having trouble sleeping and eating properly because I keep thinking about what could go wrong with my exams or graduation. Even when I try to focus on my studies, these thoughts keep creeping in, making it hard to concentrate.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>I can imagine how overwhelming and stressful that must feel. It's completely normal to feel anxious and worried about your future, especially when you're nearing a big milestone like graduation. Many students in your shoes have reported similar struggles, and it's great that you're recognizing the impact it's having on your daily life and seeking help. Can you tell me more about what you've tried so far to manage these feelings and worries?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Ah, I see what you mean. I haven't tried anything concrete to manage my anxiety, I just kind of pushed it aside thinking it would go away on its own. But now that I'm here, I realize that's not a good approach. I think I need to start by acknowledging that these feelings are normal and that I'm not alone in this experience.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>I love how you're acknowledging that your feelings are normal and that you're not alone in this struggle. It's a huge accomplishment to recognize that you don't have to face this anxiety by yourself. Can you tell me more about what you think would make a big difference for you in managing your anxiety and stress, and how you see yourself tackling those challenges in the coming weeks?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think it would be helpful to find a way to reframe my thoughts about what could go wrong and focus on the present moment. I feel like I'm constantly worrying about the future, and that's making it hard for me to enjoy the small victories along the way.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It's interesting that you bring up the idea of reframing your thoughts, because it sounds like you're already doing that to some extent by recognizing the importance of being present in the moment. And you know, research has shown that cognitive reappraisal can be a powerful tool in reducing anxiety and improving emotional regulation. Would you like to try practicing some cognitive reappraisal exercises together to help you build this skill and make some progress towards your goals?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>That sounds like a great approach! I think it would be really helpful to learn how to reframe my thoughts in a more constructive way. I've been stuck in this pattern of negative thinking for so long, and I can already imagine how empowering it would feel to be able to shift my focus towards the present moment. What kind of exercises can we do to get started?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>As you've shared, reframing your thoughts and focusing on the present moment can have a significant impact on reducing your anxiety. It's also important to recognize that it's okay to not have all the answers right now, and that it's a process to develop new skills and habits. Can you tell me about a time when you felt more present and focused on the moment, and what you think contributed to that feeling?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think I can recall a time when I was fully immersed in a project I was working on, and I was so focused on the task at hand that I didn't have time to worry about the future. It was an intense and challenging project, but I was able to stay present and motivated by breaking it down into smaller, manageable tasks. I think that experience taught me that I'm capable of staying focused and present when I'm fully engaged in something I care about.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you've had some positive experiences in the past that have helped you stay present and focused, and you're recognizing that you have the capacity to do so. I'd like to build on that sense of accomplishment and help you apply it to your current situation. Can you tell me more about what you think it is about being fully engaged in an activity that allows you to stay present and focused, and how you might be able to translate that to other areas of your life, such as your studies?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think that being fully engaged in an activity helps me stay present and focused because it allows me to break down the task into smaller, manageable parts. When I'm working on a project, I'm able to focus on one step at a time, and that reduces the anxiety and overwhelm that comes with thinking about the bigger picture. I think if I can apply that same approach to my studies, I'll be able to stay focused on the present moment and reduce my worries about the future.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It's fascinating to see how you've identified the connection between breaking down tasks and staying present, and I'm curious to explore how you might apply this approach to your studying. Can you tell me more about what you think would be the most challenging part of breaking down your studying into smaller tasks, and how you might address those challenges to stay on track?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think it would be helpful to start by breaking down my studying into smaller, manageable tasks, like setting specific goals for each study session. This would allow me to focus on one task at a time, rather than feeling overwhelmed by the entire project. I could also try to create a schedule for my studying, so I know exactly what I need to do and when. Additionally, I could reward myself for completing smaller tasks, which would give me a sense of accomplishment and motivation to keep moving forward.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're already showing a great understanding of the importance of breaking down tasks to stay present and focused, and you're taking steps to structure your studying in a way that works for you. Many students find that having a planner or a tool like that can be really helpful in staying organized and on track with their studying. Would you like to try using a planner or a similar tool to help you stay organized and focused as you work on your studying?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think it would be really helpful to have a planner or a tool like that to stay organized and focused, especially since I tend to get overwhelmed when I see the bigger picture. I've tried using different tools in the past, but I never stuck with them because I didn't see the value. But now that I'm more aware of the importance of breaking down tasks and staying present, I think having a planner could really help me stay on track and make progress towards my goals.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>By breaking down your tasks into smaller, manageable chunks, you're not only making your studying more organized, but also giving yourself a sense of control and accomplishment as you complete each segment. This can be especially helpful when feeling overwhelmed, as it allows you to focus on one task at a time and build momentum.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think that's a great approach, and I'm excited to start practicing cognitive reappraisal exercises to help me reframe my thoughts and stay present. I'm also looking forward to using a planner to help me stay organized and focused. However, I do have one concern - how do I deal with the negative thoughts and worries that keep creeping back in, even after I've reframed them?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're already taking steps towards developing a more mindful approach to your thoughts and emotions, and it's normal to experience setbacks or old patterns resurfacing as you continue to grow and learn. One thing that might be helpful is to recognize that these setbacks are a natural part of the process, and that you're not alone in struggling with them. Would you like to explore some strategies for acknowledging and gently letting go of those negative thoughts when they arise, rather than getting caught up in them again?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Ah, I see what you mean. I think I've been so focused on trying to push those negative thoughts away that I haven't really allowed myself to acknowledge and accept them. I'm starting to realize that maybe it's okay to feel overwhelmed and worried, and that it's a normal part of the process. But at the same time, I don't want to get stuck in those feelings and let them dictate my emotions. I think I need to find a way to acknowledge those thoughts and then gently let them go, rather than getting caught up in them again.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It's amazing how much more empowered you can feel when you allow yourself to feel your emotions, rather than trying to suppress them. Not only does this acceptance help you develop emotional awareness, but it can also reduce symptoms of anxiety and depression. Would you like to explore some mindfulness exercises that can help you cultivate this awareness and acceptance, and learn how to gently let go of negative thoughts when they arise?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think that's a great approach, and I'm excited to start practicing mindfulness exercises to help me cultivate emotional awareness and acceptance. I'm also looking forward to using a planner to help me stay organized and focused. But before I start, I want to make sure I understand the concept of cognitive reappraisal correctly. Can you explain it to me in simpler terms?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're really getting a good grasp on how to apply cognitive reappraisal in your daily life, and that's something to be proud of. By reframing your thoughts in a more balanced and realistic way, you're not only reducing your stress and anxiety, but also increasing your sense of control and confidence. Can you tell me more about what's been working for you so far, and what you think might be the most challenging part of this process for you?</div>

Research has shown that mindfulness can be a powerful tool in reducing symptoms of anxiety and depression. By cultivating awareness and acceptance of our emotions, we can begin to break free from the cycle of negative thoughts and worries. Can you tell me more about what you think it would mean for you to cultivate mindfulness in your daily life, and how you envision incorporating it into your routine?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think I'm starting to understand the concept of cognitive reappraisal better now. It's not just about changing my thoughts, but also about accepting and acknowledging the emotions that come with them.
