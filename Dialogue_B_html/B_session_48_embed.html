                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Hello Gregory, thank you for coming in today. How can I help you?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I just don't get why I can't seem to accept that I can't fix this. It's not like I haven't tried everything.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're shouldering a heavy burden of responsibility, feeling like you're the only one who can fix this problem, and that's a lot of pressure to put on yourself. Can you tell me more about what you mean by trying to make things right, and what specifically is driving your sense of frustration and disappointment?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>That's just it, I keep going over all the things I've tried, and I'm still no closer to finding a cure. It's like I'm stuck in this rut, and I don't know how to get out of it.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're carrying a lot of emotional weight from this experience, and it's understandable that you would feel that way. Can you tell me more about what's been going on for you lately, and how you've been coping with the frustration and disappointment?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>It's hard for me to even think about anything else, my mind is always consumed by thoughts of what I could've done differently, what I should've done, and how I can make things better. It's like I'm trapped in this cycle of self-blame and guilt, and I don't know how to break free.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>I can imagine how this cycle of self-blame and guilt can feel like a heavy weight on your shoulders, making it difficult to move forward and find a sense of closure. Can you help me understand what you think would happen if you were to accept the situation as it is, rather than trying to fix it or change the past?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I don't know, maybe if I just gave up and accepted that I'll never find a cure, I could finally move on and move forward. But the thought of giving up feels like admitting defeat, and I'm not ready to do that. It's like I'm stuck between trying to find a solution and accepting the reality of the situation.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It's understandable that you feel stuck between these two conflicting desires, and it's not uncommon to struggle with the fear of admitting defeat or surrendering to a situation. Can you help me explore what would happen if you were to take a step back and focus on the present moment, rather than trying to change the past or control the future?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I guess I'm afraid that if I give up and accept the situation, I'll be letting myself and my wife down.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It's clear that the weight of responsibility and the fear of not meeting your own expectations is really taking a toll on you, and it's understandable that you'd feel that sense of pressure to perform. Can you help me understand what you think your role is in your wife's life, and how you perceive your responsibility towards her, especially considering her deafness? How do you think that might be impacting your feelings of guilt and failure?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>That's a good question. I feel like I'm supposed to be able to make her happy, to be the one who can fix everything for her. And because I'm not able to do that, I feel like I'm failing her, like I'm not good enough for her. It's like I'm constantly striving to be this perfect husband, and when I fail, it feels like I'm not worthy of her love.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>As you're shouldering this incredible responsibility, it's no wonder you're feeling overwhelmed and stuck. Can you help me understand what you think would happen if you were to start letting go of the need to be the perfect husband and provider, and instead focus on being present and supportive in your relationship with your wife? How might that change your experience of being a partner to her, and what kind of freedom and relief might you experience if you were to release some of that pressure?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I guess I've always thought that being a good husband meant being able to fix everything for my wife, but now I'm starting to realize that's not what she needs from me. She needs someone who can be present with her, support her, and love her for who she is, deafness and all.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>As you explore this new understanding of what it means to be a good husband, I want to acknowledge that it can be a significant adjustment to let go of the expectation to be the problem-solver and instead, focus on being present and supportive. It's not uncommon for people to struggle with feelings of guilt and failure when they realize that they've been carrying an unfair burden in their relationships. Can you tell me more about what's coming up for you as you consider this shift, and how you think it might impact your daily life and your sense of identity as a husband and partner?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>It's hard for me to even imagine what it would look like to be a good husband without trying to fix everything for my wife. I feel like I've been so focused on being the problem-solver that I've neglected other aspects of our relationship.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like this realization about being present and supportive in your relationship has been a significant turning point for you. Can you tell me more about what's been most challenging for you about letting go of the need to fix everything for your wife, and how you think this shift might impact your relationship in the long run?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think it's scary to let go of the idea that I can fix everything for my wife because it means I'm not in control. It feels like I'm giving up, like I'm admitting defeat. But at the same time, I'm starting to realize that my wife doesn't need me to fix everything for her, she just needs me to be present and supportive. It's a hard balance to strike, but I think it's what I need to do if I want to move forward and be a good husband to her.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>As you're recognizing the importance of being present and supportive in your relationship with your wife, I want to acknowledge that it can be a huge shift to let go of the need to control and fix everything for her. It's like you're trading in a sense of accomplishment for a deeper connection and understanding. Can you tell me more about what you think this new approach might look like in your daily interactions with your wife, and how you envision your communication changing as a result?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I'm starting to see that my need to fix everything for my wife is rooted in my own insecurity and fear of not being good enough for her. It's like I'm trying to prove myself to her by being the problem-solver, but that's not what she needs from me. I need to focus on being present and supportive, and let go of the need to control and fix everything. It's scary to admit, but I think I've been using my wife's deafness as a way to prove my worth as a husband, and that's not healthy.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're struggling with a sense of responsibility and obligation to fix everything for your wife, and that this need is deeply tied to your own insecurities and fears. Can you help me understand how you think this dynamic might be impacting your own emotional well-being and sense of fulfillment in the relationship, and what steps you think you might need to take to start releasing some of that emotional weight?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>It's like I've been carrying this weight around for so long, and I'm only just starting to realize that it's not about me being able to fix everything for my wife, but about being present and supportive. It's scary to let go of the need to control and fix everything, but I think it's what I need to do if I want to move forward and be a good husband to her.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It's fascinating to me that you're starting to see the ways in which your own fears and insecurities have driven your need to control and fix everything for your wife. This recognition can be a powerful step towards building a more authentic and equal partnership. Can you help me understand what it would mean for you to start exploring and expressing those underlying fears and insecurities with your wife, rather than trying to suppress or avoid them?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I'm starting to see that my need to fix everything for my wife is rooted in my own insecurity and fear of not being good enough for her.

                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>As you continue to explore this new understanding, I sense that you're also starting to recognize the ways in which your own fears and insecurities have been driving your need for control and fix-it solutions. It's remarkable that you're acknowledging the ways in which your wife's deafness and your parents' advanced age have likely contributed to these feelings of responsibility and pressure to be a certain kind of partner or provider. How do you think your understanding of these underlying dynamics might help you start to let go of some of these external expectations and find a more authentic and fulfilling way of being in your relationship?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think I'm finally starting to see that my need to fix everything for my wife is not about her, but about my own insecurities and fears.

                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>As you acknowledge the connection between your need to fix everything for your wife and your own insecurities and fears, I'm curious to explore how this newfound awareness might impact your daily interactions with her. Can you think of a specific situation where you've felt the urge to control and fix everything, and what did you do when you felt that urge?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I remember one evening when my wife was struggling to communicate with our neighbor, who was speaking loudly. I felt this overwhelming urge to intervene and help her, but instead, I took a step back and realized that she was trying to figure it out on her own. It was hard for me to let go of my need to control the situation, but I eventually realized that my wife was capable of handling it herself. It was a small moment, but it was a big realization for me.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>That awareness and trust in your wife's abilities, as well as your own vulnerabilities, can be a powerful catalyst for growth and change in your relationship. Can you help me understand what you think would be the most challenging part of embracing your own imperfections and trusting your wife to handle things on her own, and how you might begin to work through those challenges and build a more equal partnership?</div>

In fact, research suggests that many individuals, especially men, often struggle with feelings of inadequacy, anxiety, and fear of loss, which can manifest as a need to control and fix everything for their partner.
