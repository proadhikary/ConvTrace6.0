                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Hi Brianna, thank you for joining me today. How are you feeling about having this session?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I don't really know what to expect. I guess I just feel kind of stuck with these negative thoughts.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're experiencing a mix of emotions and thoughts that are making it challenging for you to feel confident about our session. Can you help me understand what specifically is triggering these negative thoughts and feelings of uncertainty?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I don't know, it's just that I feel like I'm stuck in this pattern of negative thinking and I don't know how to get out of it. Every time something bad happens, I immediately assume it's because of something I did wrong, and it's hard for me to shake off those feelings.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It's really common to experience a mix of emotions when we're struggling with negative thought patterns, and it sounds like you're feeling both frustrated and stuck. Can you help me understand what you think is driving this self-criticism and blame, and what you hope to achieve by breaking free from this cycle?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think it's just because I'm afraid of failure and rejection. I don't want to be seen as a bad gamer or a failure in general. And I don't know how to stop beating myself up over these thoughts.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're carrying around a lot of emotional weight from those experiences, and it's impacting your daily life as a gamer. I'm wondering, what do you think would happen if you were to let go of that assumption that your mistakes are a reflection of your worth as a gamer? Would that give you any sense of relief or freedom?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I don't know... it's hard for me to imagine not beating myself up over my mistakes. It's just what I do, and I don't think I can change it. Plus, it feels like everyone else is better than me, and I'm just not good enough.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It makes sense that you'd feel overwhelmed by these negative thoughts, especially when they're tied to something you're passionate about like gaming. Can you help me understand what you think would happen if you didn't feel like you weren't good enough? Would you be able to focus more on the fun aspects of gaming, or would it be hard to shake off those feelings of inadequacy?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I guess it's hard for me to imagine being able to let go of those negative thoughts because they feel like a part of who I am. I've been thinking this way for so long that it's hard for me to picture myself thinking differently. And the thought of people judging me or thinking I'm not good enough is really scary.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're carrying a heavy burden of self-doubt and negative self-talk, and it's taken a toll on your mental well-being. Can you help me understand what you think would happen if you were to start practicing self-compassion and challenging those negative thoughts? How do you think that would impact your daily life and relationships?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I don't know, it feels like I've been stuck in this pattern for so long that I'm not even sure who I am without those negative thoughts. It's scary to think about changing because it feels like a part of my identity, and I don't know if I could be happy without those feelings of inadequacy.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It makes sense that you'd feel uncertain about changing your thought patterns, as they've been a part of your identity for so long. And it's interesting that you mention self-compassion, because research has shown that practicing self-compassion can actually help to rewire our brains and reduce negative thought patterns. Would you be open to exploring some strategies for practicing self-compassion, and seeing if that might be a starting point for you as you work to shift your thought patterns?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I'm not sure, I feel like I've been stuck in this pattern for so long that it's hard for me to imagine being a different person. It's scary to think about changing because it feels like a part of my identity, and I don't know if I could be happy without those feelings of inadequacy.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It's really interesting that you're noticing how these negative thought patterns have become so ingrained in your experience of gaming and competing, and how they're affecting your self-image. Can you tell me more about what it would mean to you to break free from that cycle of self-criticism and start treating yourself with the same kindness and understanding that you would offer to a friend?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I'm not sure, I feel like I've been stuck in this pattern for so long that it's hard for me to imagine being a different person. It's scary to think about changing because it feels like a part of my identity, and I don't know if I could be happy without those feelings of inadequacy.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>I can understand why it would be daunting to consider shifting away from a way of thinking that's been with you for so long, and it's interesting that you mention the fear of losing a part of yourself. It's almost as if your negative self-talk has become a familiar companion, and the thought of letting it go feels like it would leave a void. Can you help me understand what you think would need to happen for you to feel like you could start to let go of that companion, and what would you hope to find in its place?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I guess I'm just really scared of change, and the thought of not being a failure or not being seen as a bad gamer is really appealing to me. But at the same time, I don't know if I can imagine being happy without those feelings of inadequacy. It feels like a part of who I am, and I don't know if I can let go of it.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like this fear of loss and uncertainty is really tied up with your sense of identity as a gamer, and it's affecting your ability to enjoy the game and connect with others. Can you help me understand what you think would happen if you were able to reframe your identity away from being defined solely by your gaming performance, and towards being a multifaceted person with many different passions and interests?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think I understand what you're getting at, but it's really hard for me to imagine not being defined by my gaming performance. It's like, who would I be without that? I feel like it's a big part of my identity, and I don't know how to separate myself from it. Maybe if I could find other things that I'm good at, or that I enjoy, then I could start to see myself as more than just a gamer. But it's hard for me to imagine that because I've been so focused on gaming for so long.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It's clear that you're grappling with some significant emotional weight tied to your gaming identity, and it's completely normal to feel uncertain about making changes. Can you help me understand what specifically is driving your fear of exploring other hobbies or interests outside of gaming, and how you think that might impact your sense of self?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>It's just that I feel like I've been so focused on gaming for so long that I don't know if I can imagine being good at anything else. I'm scared that I'll try something new and I'll be terrible at it, and that will just add to my feelings of inadequacy.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It's interesting that you bring up the idea of needing to be perfect in order to be a real gamer. It's like you're putting a lot of pressure on yourself to live up to a certain standard. Can you help me understand what you think would happen if you were to challenge that idea and start to see yourself as a gamer with strengths and weaknesses, rather than perfection being the only acceptable outcome?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think I understand what you're getting at, but it's really hard for me to imagine not being defined by my gaming performance.

                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It's remarkable how closely tied your sense of self-worth is to your gaming performance, and how that's affecting your overall well-being. Can you help me understand what you think would happen if you were to start to separate your identity from your gaming achievements, and instead focus on the aspects of gaming that bring you joy and fulfillment?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I'm starting to realize that my negative thoughts are not only affecting my gaming experience but also my relationships and daily life. I feel like I'm stuck in this pattern of self-criticism and I don't know how to break free from it. The thought of changing is scary because it feels like a part of my identity, but at the same time, I'm tired of feeling like I'm not good enough. I think I need to start practicing self-compassion and challenging those negative thoughts, but it's hard for me to imagine being a different person.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It's interesting that you mention the idea of taking small steps towards practicing self-compassion and challenging those negative thoughts. I think it's really important to recognize that we don't have to do it all at once, and that small changes can add up over time. What do you think would be a small step that you could take today to start practicing more self-compassion and challenging those negative thoughts?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think I'm starting to realize that my negative thoughts are not only affecting my gaming experience but also my relationships and daily life.

                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're starting to recognize the connection between your negative thoughts and your feelings of inadequacy. It's interesting that you mention the idea of seeking validation from others, and I want to gently challenge that idea. Can you help me understand what it would mean to you to develop a sense of self-worth that's not dependent on the opinions of others? Perhaps we can explore ways to cultivate self-compassion and self-acceptance, even when you're not performing well in your games.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I'm starting to feel overwhelmed by these negative thoughts and emotions.

I feel like I'm constantly beating myself up over my mistakes, and it's affecting my relationships and daily life. I'm tired of feeling like I'm not good enough, and I don't know how to stop these negative thoughts from controlling my life.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It's really common for people to get caught up in negative thought patterns, and it's amazing that you're recognizing the impact it's having on your life. Can you help me understand what you think would happen if you were to start to challenge these negative thoughts and reframe them in a more balanced way, rather than believing them as facts?</div>

                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It's not uncommon for people to feel stuck in patterns of negative thinking and self-criticism, and it takes a lot of courage to acknowledge the impact it's having on your life. In fact, research suggests that our brains are wired to respond to threats, and when we're constantly focusing on our flaws and mistakes, it can trigger a stress response that makes it even harder to shift our thinking. Would you like to explore some strategies for reframing your negative thoughts and emotions in a more balanced way, and see if that might help you feel more grounded and less overwhelmed?</div>

                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>As you explore the possibility of shifting your perspective and reframing your negative thoughts, I want to acknowledge that it's a big ask to confront and change habits that have been ingrained for so long. It's not uncommon for people to feel uncertain or resistant to change, especially when it comes to something as deeply ingrained as self-criticism. Can you tell me more about what's holding you back from taking those first steps towards making a change?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think I'm just really scared of change, and the thought of not being a failure or not being seen as a bad gamer is really appealing to me.

                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It's clear that you've been shouldering a significant emotional burden tied to your gaming experiences, and it's understandable that you'd want to hold onto that sense of identity. Can you tell me more about what you think would happen if you were to start exploring other aspects of yourself, like your interests and passions outside of gaming? What do you think would be the benefits and drawbacks of doing so? Additionally, I want to acknowledge that it's okay to take things one step at a time, and we can work together to break down the process of change into smaller, more manageable steps.</div>
