                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Hello, Riley. Welcome to the session. How are you feeling today?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I've just been struggling a lot with finding meaning in what I do. It's been hard to stay motivated, and I feel like I'm not making any real progress.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're feeling really stuck and unsure about your sense of purpose, and that's making it tough to find motivation and energy for the things that used to bring you joy. Can you help me understand what's been going on that's making you feel this way? Have there been any specific situations or experiences that have contributed to this sense of dissatisfaction?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah, it's been a gradual process, I think. I used to love competing and being an athlete, but over the past year, it's just started to feel like a chore. I feel like I'm going through the motions, but I'm not really passionate about it anymore. And when I watch documentaries or read about people who have explored the world, I just feel like I'm missing out on so much. It's like I'm stuck in this rut and I don't know how to get out of it.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It's interesting that you bring up the idea of exploration and seeing the world, and how that might be feeling out of reach for you right now. Can you help me understand what specifically about exploration and traveling feels like it's missing from your life, and how do you think you might be able to find ways to still experience that sense of adventure and curiosity even if it's not through traditional means of travel?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think it's just the sense of freedom and spontaneity that comes with traveling that I'm craving. As an athlete, I'm so structured and planned out all the time, and it feels like I'm missing out on that kind of excitement and unpredictability. And when I see people who have explored the world, I feel like they're living life on their own terms, and it's hard not to compare myself to that.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It's no wonder you're feeling this sense of restlessness and dissatisfaction, given the intensity of your athletic training and the pressure to perform. It's like your spirit is craving a break from the structure and rigidity, and you're yearning for something more spontaneous and freeing.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think that's a big part of it - the feeling of being trapped in a routine that I didn't choose for myself. I never thought I'd be an athlete my whole life, and now that I'm stuck in this cycle, it feels suffocating.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Can you help me understand what specifically is driving this sense of suffocation, is it the feeling of being trapped in the athletic routine itself, or is it the sense of missing out on other experiences and opportunities that you feel like you've put on hold to focus on your athletics?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>It's definitely the feeling of being trapped in the athletic routine itself. I feel like I'm just going through the motions, and I'm not really living my own life. The thought of continuing to do this for the next few years is just overwhelming, and it's making me feel really anxious and stressed out.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It's common to feel like you're losing yourself in the process of pursuing a goal, especially one that's been driven by others' expectations rather than your own. Can you help me understand what you think would happen if you were to take a step back and prioritize your own needs and desires, even if that means redefining what it means to be a successful athlete?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah, that's scary to think about, but at the same time, it's also kind of liberating to imagine what could happen if I took control of my own life and made choices that align with my own values and passions.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>As you explore this idea of taking control of your own life and making choices that align with your values and passions, what do you think would be the most empowering part of that process for you?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think it would be really empowering to have the freedom to make choices that I want to make, without having to consider what others expect of me. It's like, I've always been driven by what my coaches and parents want me to do, but if I could break free from that and make my own decisions, I think that would be a huge weight lifted off my shoulders.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It's fascinating to see how your passion for photography has evolved into a symbol of autonomy and self-expression, and it's not hard to understand why you'd crave that sense of control and agency in your life. Can you tell me more about what specifically about photography resonates with you, and how you think it might be a way for you to cultivate a sense of empowerment and freedom in your life?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>It's funny, I never thought about photography as a way to gain control over my life, but now that you mention it, it makes a lot of sense. I think what I love about photography is that it's a way for me to express myself and capture moments that are meaningful to me, without having to follow a specific plan or routine. It's like, I can just show up and be present in the moment, without having to worry about what others expect of me. And that feeling of freedom and spontaneity is something that I crave in other areas of my life too.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>As you explore the connection between photography and autonomy, it's interesting to note that many people with strong creative passions often report feeling a sense of fulfillment and purpose when they're able to express themselves freely. Research has shown that engaging in activities that allow for self-expression and autonomy can lead to increased feelings of motivation, satisfaction, and overall well-being. How do you think you might be able to incorporate more of these elements into your daily life, not just through photography, but also in your relationships and other areas of your life?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think I can start by taking small steps towards exploring my passion for photography and using it as a way to express myself, even if it's just for a few minutes each day. Maybe I can start by setting aside a specific time each day to take photos, or finding online courses or tutorials to help me improve my skills. I also want to start having more open and honest conversations with my coaches and parents about my feelings and desires, and see if we can find a way to make some changes that align with what I want.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It's exciting to see how you're recognizing the importance of prioritizing your own needs and desires, and how that might lead to a sense of empowerment and freedom. As you start to make small changes and take control of your own life, it's essential to remember that it's okay to make mistakes and adjust course as needed. In fact, research suggests that embracing imperfection and uncertainty can be a crucial part of the growth and self-discovery process. What do you think would happen if you approached these changes with a sense of curiosity and experimentation, rather than perfectionism?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think that would be really helpful. If I approached these changes with a sense of curiosity and experimentation, I might be more open to trying new things and learning from my mistakes. It's like, I've always been so focused on being perfect and doing everything just right, but if I can let go of that and just be willing to try and learn, I think I might be more likely to find what I'm looking for.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>As you're recognizing the importance of prioritizing your own needs and desires, it's also essential to acknowledge that it's okay to make mistakes and adjust course as needed.

                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think I need to focus on finding ways to make my athletic career more meaningful and fulfilling, rather than just going through the motions. Maybe I can start by exploring other aspects of my life, like photography, and seeing if I can find ways to incorporate them into my daily routine. I also want to start having more open and honest conversations with my coaches and parents about my feelings and desires, and see if we can find a way to make some changes that align with what I want.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're recognizing that your desire for exploration and spontaneity is not just limited to traveling, but also desires expression and autonomy in other areas of your life, including your athletic career. Can you help me understand what you think would happen if you were to start prioritizing your own needs and desires in your athletic pursuits, rather than just focusing on meeting others' expectations? How might that impact your sense of purpose and motivation?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah, I think it would be really empowering to have the freedom to make choices that I want to make, without having to consider what others expect of me.

                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>As you break free from the weight of others' expectations and start making choices that align with your own values and passions, I'm curious to explore how you think this shift might impact your sense of identity and self-worth. Are there any aspects of yourself that you feel like you've had to suppress or hide in order to fit into someone else's mold, and how do you think you might start to bring those parts of yourself back into the forefront of your life?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think I've been so focused on trying to meet everyone else's expectations that I've lost sight of what I truly want. I've been living my life according to what others think I should be doing, rather than what I actually want. It's like, I've been going through the motions, trying to be the perfect athlete, but it's not fulfilling. I need to start making choices that align with my own values and passions, even if it means taking a different path. I need to learn to prioritize my own needs and desires, rather than trying to fit into someone else's mold.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>As you start to prioritize your own needs and desires, it's also essential to recognize that this shift is a common and natural part of human development. Many people go through a process of re-evaluating their priorities and values, and it can be a powerful catalyst for personal growth and self-discovery. Can you help me understand what you think would happen if you were to approach this transition with a sense of curiosity and openness, rather than anxiety or uncertainty?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I'm starting to realize that I've been living my life according to what others think I should be doing, and it's not fulfilling.

I need to learn to prioritize my own needs and desires, rather than trying to fit into someone else's mold.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>As you start to imagine what it would be like to prioritize your own needs and desires, I want to acknowledge that this can be a scary and uncertain process. It's natural to worry about what others might think or to feel uncertain about what the future holds. But I want to reassure you that it's okay to take things one step at a time and that it's okay to not have all the answers right now.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think I'm starting to realize that my desire for exploration and spontaneity isn't just limited to traveling, but also desires expression and autonomy in other areas of my life, including my athletic career.

                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It's fascinating to see how your desire for autonomy and self-expression is emerging in your passion for photography, and how it's challenging your current path as an athlete. Can you help me understand what you think would be the most significant benefits of integrating more creativity and freedom into your daily life, and how you envision balancing these new pursuits with your existing commitments in athletics?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think I've been so focused on trying to meet everyone else's expectations that I've lost sight of what I truly want.

It's almost as if you're standing at a crossroads, with multiple paths unfolding before you, each representing a different aspect of your life. Can we take a moment to imagine what each of these paths might look like, and what kind of signs or markers would indicate which one is the most aligned with your values and passions?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think it's really interesting that you bring up the idea of standing at a crossroads, because I do feel like I'm at a point where I need to make some big decisions about my life.

I've been living my life according to what others think I should be doing, rather than what I actually want.

                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>As you start to imagine what each of these paths might look like, I want to acknowledge that it's a big ask to try to figure out the entire plan right now. It sounds like you're already feeling a sense of overwhelm and uncertainty, and adding the pressure of having to make a definitive decision on top of that could be really challenging. Instead, what if we focus on just taking one small step towards exploring your values and passions, and then see where that leads you?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think I'm finally starting to realize that my dissatisfaction with my current job as an athlete stems from a deeper desire for autonomy and self-expression.

Can we explore how you think you can start to prioritize your own values and passions in your daily life, and what small steps you might take to align with what truly matters to you?</div>
