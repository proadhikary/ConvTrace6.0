                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Hello Edward, it's nice to meet you. What brings you to counseling today?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Honestly, it's just that every time I tell someone I'm an accountant, I can see their eyes glaze over. It's like they're already bored before I even get a chance to say anything else.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>I can totally see how that would be really demoralizing for you, Edward. It sounds like you're craving a sense of connection and understanding from others, but instead, you're getting a sense of boredom and disinterest. Can you think of any ways you could reframe your thinking around these interactions, maybe focus on the aspects that bring you joy and fulfillment, rather than the ones that drain your energy?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I don't know... I just feel like it's so hard to shake off this feeling of being boring. It's like, no matter what I do or say, people are just going to see me as an accountant and not really care about anything else.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It's interesting that you mention feeling like you're stuck in this rut, and I can see how that would be really frustrating for you. Can you tell me more about what you think would change if you were able to break free from this perception that others have of you as just an accountant? What are some things that you wish people would see or appreciate about you beyond your job title?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I wish people could see that I have other interests and hobbies outside of work, like my passion for photography and hiking. I feel like those things make me a more well-rounded person, but no one ever asks about them. It's like I'm just defined by my job title and that's it.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It's interesting that you mention feeling like people would be more interested in those aspects of you if they just took the time to ask. I think that's a really astute observation, and it's not uncommon for people to feel like they're being seen only in one dimension, whether that's through their job title or something else. Can you think of a specific situation where you felt like someone did take the time to ask about your hobbies or interests outside of work, and how did that make you feel?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah, I can think of one time when a friend asked me about my photography, and it was really nice to talk about it with someone who was genuinely interested. For a moment, I felt like I was being seen as more than just an accountant, like I was a person with passions and interests. But then, of course, we went back to talking about work, and the whole thing felt like just a brief respite from the usual. It's hard to shake the feeling that I'm just pretending to be someone I'm not, even when I'm trying to be authentic and share my interests with others.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It's not uncommon for people to struggle with feeling like they're living in multiple worlds, especially when there's a significant difference between their work and personal life. It sounds like you're carrying a weight of expectation and responsibility on your shoulders, and it can be exhausting trying to balance all of these different aspects of yourself. Can you tell me more about what you think would happen if you were able to find a way to integrate your hobbies and interests more seamlessly into your daily life, rather than feeling like they're separate from your identity as an accountant?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I don't know... it's like, I've tried to talk about my photography and hiking with colleagues and friends, but it always feels like they're just humoring me or pretending to be interested, like they're waiting for the conversation to get back to my job. It's hard to explain, but it's like I'm trying to be myself, but no one wants to see the real me.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're carrying a heavy load of uncertainty and self-doubt, and it's affecting your ability to feel authentic and accepted by others. Can you help me understand what you think would happen if you were able to let go of the need for others to validate your hobbies and interests, and instead focus on what brings you joy and fulfillment in the moment?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I'm just so tired of feeling like I'm living a lie, like I'm pretending to be someone I'm not. It's exhausting trying to keep up this image of being just an accountant, and it feels like no one really sees the real me.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>I can totally understand why you'd feel like you're living in a constructed version of yourself, Edward. It's like you're putting on a mask every morning and trying to make it stick, but it's not a natural fit. Can you tell me more about what you think would happen if you were able to let go of that mask and just be yourself, without the need to justify or explain your hobbies and interests to others? How do you think that would affect your relationships and your sense of self?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think it's hard for me to imagine a life where I'm not defined by my job title, where I'm not constantly worried about what others think of me as an accountant. It feels like that's all I've ever been to anyone, and it's hard to shake the feeling that I'm stuck in this one dimension.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It's interesting that you mention feeling like you're living up to others' expectations, Edward. I think it's common for people to put a lot of weight on what others think of them, especially in a profession like accounting where there's a strong sense of responsibility and accountability. Can you help me understand what you think would happen if you were to separate your sense of self-worth from your job title and focus on what brings you joy and fulfillment in the moment?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>It's hard for me to imagine a life where I'm not constantly worried about what others think of me as an accountant. I feel like that's all I've ever been to anyone, and it's hard to shake the feeling that I'm stuck in this one dimension.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It's fascinating to me how this sense of self-worth tied to your job title has become so deeply ingrained, Edward. Can you help me understand what you think would happen if you were to explore this idea that your sense of self-worth comes from within, rather than from external validation?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>It's true, it's like I'm stuck in this cycle of feeling like I need to justify myself as an accountant, like I'm constantly trying to prove myself to others. I don't know if I'll ever be able to break free from it, but I'm willing to try to see things from a different perspective, to focus on the things that bring me joy and fulfillment, rather than just trying to fit into someone else's expectations.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're already taking a big step by acknowledging the weight of others' expectations and the toll it's taking on your energy and happiness. Can you tell me more about what you think would happen if you were to slowly start letting go of the need to justify yourself as an accountant, and instead, focus on what brings you joy and fulfillment in the moment?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I guess it's hard for me to imagine a life where I'm not constantly worried about what others think of me as an accountant. It feels like that's all I've ever been to anyone, and it's hard to shake the feeling that I'm stuck in this one dimension. It's like I'm always trying to prove myself, to show that I'm more than just a number cruncher. But at the same time, I'm scared of being authentic and vulnerable because I'm afraid of being rejected or judged. It's this constant tug-of-war between wanting to be accepted and wanting to be true to myself.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're carrying a significant amount of emotional weight due to the pressure to conform to certain expectations, and it's impacting your sense of self-worth. Can you help me understand what you think would happen if you were to take a small step towards embracing your authenticity, whether that's through exploring new hobbies or spending time with people who accept you for who you are, without the need for justification or explanation?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I don't know, it feels like I'm stuck in this rut and I don't know how to get out of it. I feel like I'm constantly trying to prove myself as an accountant, and it's exhausting.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It's amazing how much energy and creativity can be drained by the constant need to justify ourselves to others, isn't it? Can you help me understand what you think would happen if you were to free yourself from the requirement to explain or justify your hobbies and interests to others, and instead, simply allowed yourself to explore and enjoy them without apology or justification?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I'm starting to realize that I've been living this life where I'm constantly trying to prove myself as an accountant, and it's exhausting. I feel like I'm stuck in this cycle of feeling like I need to justify myself to others, and it's taking a toll on my mental health and overall well-being. I'm scared to be authentic and vulnerable because I'm afraid of being rejected or judged, but at the same time, I'm tired of living this life where I'm not being true to myself. I think I'm ready to start exploring new hobbies and spending time with people who accept me for who I am, without the need for justification or explanation.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're already taking a big step by acknowledging the weight of others' expectations and the toll it's taking on your mental health and well-being. I want to normalize this experience for you, Edward, as it's common for people to feel trapped by the need to conform to certain standards. Can you help me understand what you think would happen if you were to start practicing self-compassion and acceptance, not just towards your hobbies and interests, but towards yourself as a person with multiple passions and identities?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I'm trying to wrap my head around the idea that I don't need to justify my hobbies and interests to others, that I can just enjoy them without apology or expectation. It feels like a huge weight has been lifted off my shoulders, like I'm finally free to be myself without the constant need to prove myself as an accountant. But at the same time, I'm scared to let go of this need for validation from others, scared that I'll be rejected or judged if I'm not constantly justifying myself.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>As you've started to recognize the value in pursuing your hobbies and interests outside of work, I want to build on that sense of empowerment by acknowledging that it's not uncommon for people to struggle with the tension between their work and personal identities. In fact, research has shown that many individuals experience a sense of disconnection or fragmentation when their work and personal selves don't align. Can you help me understand how you think this realization might impact your sense of self-compassion and acceptance, especially as you continue to explore and prioritize your own needs and desires?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I'm still trying to wrap my head around the idea that I don't need to justify my hobbies and interests to others, that I can just enjoy them without apology or expectation. It feels like a huge weight has been lifted off my shoulders, like I'm finally free to be myself without the constant need to prove myself as an accountant. But at the same time, I'm scared to let go of this need for validation from others, scared that I'll be rejected or judged if I'm not constantly justifying myself.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It's amazing to see how acknowledging this need for validation has given you a sense of relief and freedom, Edward. I want to emphasize that it's a common and normal experience to feel this pressure to conform, especially in a profession like accounting where there are high standards and expectations. In fact, research has shown that people often prioritize others' expectations over their own needs and desires as a way to avoid conflict or maintain relationships. Can you help me understand how you think this newfound awareness might impact your relationships with others, and how you might start to prioritize your own needs and desires in a way that feels authentic and fulfilling to you?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I don't know, it feels like I'm just stuck in this cycle of feeling like I need to prove myself as an accountant, and it's exhausting.

                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're carrying a heavy burden, Edward, and it's beautiful that you're starting to recognize the weight of others' expectations and the toll it's taking on your mental health and well-being. I want to help you explore this idea that your sense of self-worth and identity are deeply connected to your work as an accountant, and that it's possible to separate your sense of self-worth from your job title.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I'm still trying to wrap my head around the idea that I don't need to justify my hobbies and interests to others, that I can just enjoy them without apology or expectation.

                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It's amazing to see how far you've come in just a short time, Edward. You've begun to recognize the weight of others' expectations and the toll it's taking on your mental health and well-being, and that's a huge step forward. It's common for people to feel trapped by the need to conform to certain standards, and it sounds like you're starting to break free from that cycle. Can you help me understand what you think would happen if you were to continue exploring and prioritizing your own needs and desires, and what role you think your sense of purpose and fulfillment might play in that process?</div>
