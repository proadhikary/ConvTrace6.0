                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Hi Kayla, it's nice to meet you. I'm looking forward to our session today. Can you tell me a bit about what's bringing you here?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I've been working at the grocery store for three years now, and every time I get my paycheck, I try to budget for moving out, but it just feels impossible. It's frustrating to see people around my age being able to live on their own while I feel stuck.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like this feeling of being stuck is really weighing on you, and it's not just about the financial aspect, but also about the sense of independence and autonomy that comes with living on your own. Can you help me understand what you think would be the next step for you to take in order to start making progress towards moving out, and what's holding you back from taking that step right now?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I'm not sure, to be honest. I've tried increasing my working hours and cutting back on expenses, but it seems like no matter what I do, I just can't seem to make it work. It's like I'm constantly stuck in this rut and I don't know how to get out of it.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're feeling really stuck and frustrated, and no matter what you try, you're not seeing any progress towards moving out. That can be really demoralizing and tough to deal with. It's normal to feel that way when you're facing a challenging situation like this, and it's great that you're acknowledging your feelings. Can you help me understand what you think would be the most helpful next step for you to take in order to start making progress towards moving out?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think what would be helpful is if I could just stop feeling so stuck and anxious about it all the time. I wish I could just shake off the feeling that I'll never be able to move out and just focus on the things I can control, like my job and my budget. Maybe if I could just calm down and not feel so overwhelmed, I could start to see some progress again.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It's amazing how when we're feeling overwhelmed, our minds can get stuck in a cycle of negative thoughts and feelings. It's like your mind is trying to protect you from perceived failure, but in doing so, it's actually holding you back from taking action. Would you be open to exploring some techniques to help you break free from this cycle and cultivate a more empowering mindset?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think that would be really helpful, actually. I've tried to focus on the positive aspects of my life, like my job and my relationships, but it's hard to shake off the feeling that I'm stuck and not making progress. I've also tried to practice mindfulness and meditation, but it's hard for me to quiet my mind when I'm feeling so anxious and overwhelmed. Maybe we could work on some strategies to help me manage my anxiety and build my confidence so that I can start taking steps towards moving out again.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It's interesting that you mention feeling like you're not making progress, and that's affecting your sense of identity and purpose. Can you help me understand what you mean by progress in this context? Is it about achieving a specific goal, like moving out, or is it more about feeling like you're moving forward in life, gaining independence, and developing a sense of self?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think it's a bit of both, honestly. I mean, moving out and being independent is a huge part of it, but it's also about feeling like I'm moving forward in life and developing a sense of self. When I think about my future, I feel like I'm stuck in this rut and I'm not really sure how to get out of it. It's like I'm just going through the motions of daily life without any real sense of purpose or direction.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>As you're feeling stuck and uncertain about your future, it's understandable that you're craving a sense of direction and purpose in your life. It sounds like you're struggling to find a sense of momentum and progress, which can be really frustrating and overwhelming. Can you help me understand what you think is holding you back from creating the life you want to live?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think part of the problem is that I've been so focused on the financial aspect of moving out that I haven't really thought about what I want to do with my life or what kind of person I want to be. I feel like I've been living other people's expectations, whether it's my parents' or society's, and I haven't really taken the time to figure out what I want. I'm not even sure what I'm passionate about or what makes me happy. It's like I'm just going through the motions of daily life without any real sense of purpose or direction.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>As you've been carrying around this sense of disconnection and lack of direction, it's no wonder you're feeling stuck and uncertain about your future. It's like you're trying to navigate a map without a compass, and it can be really overwhelming. Can you help me understand what you think would happen if you were to take a step back and explore what brings you joy and fulfillment, even if it's not directly related to moving out?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think that's a really good point, and it's something I've been trying to figure out lately. I've been feeling like I'm just going through the motions of daily life without any real sense of purpose or direction. Maybe if I could just take some time to explore what brings me joy and fulfillment, I could start to feel more connected to myself and my life. I've always loved art, but I never thought of it as a viable career option, so maybe I could explore that further.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It's great that you're recognizing the importance of pursuing your passions and values in your life. It's not uncommon for people to struggle with combining their practical responsibilities with their creative pursuits, but it sounds like you're taking a step towards acknowledging the importance of both in your life. Can you tell me more about what you think would happen if you were able to make more time for your art, and what that would mean for your sense of fulfillment and purpose?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think that making more time for my art would help me feel more connected to myself and my life. It would give me a sense of purpose and direction, and it would help me feel more fulfilled and happy.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It's fascinating to see how your passion for art is craving expression in your life, and it's not surprising that you're feeling a sense of disconnection when you're not making time for it. Research has shown that engaging in creative activities can have a profound impact on our mental health and well-being, and it's amazing that you're starting to recognize the importance of nurturing this part of yourself. Can you help me understand what you think would happen if you were to make a conscious effort to prioritize your art, even if it's just a small amount of time each week?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think prioritizing my art would help me feel more grounded and connected to myself. It would give me a sense of control over my life and help me feel less stuck. When I'm creating, I feel like I'm able to tap into a deeper part of myself and express emotions and thoughts that I might not be able to verbalize otherwise. It's like my art is a way for me to communicate with myself and the world around me.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>As you continue to explore the connection between your art and your sense of self, I want to acknowledge that it's not uncommon for people to struggle with prioritizing their creative pursuits, especially when they feel like they're not making a living from them. It's almost as if society has conditioned us to believe that our creative expression should be secondary to our practical responsibilities. But what if it's not either/or, but rather both/and? What if prioritizing your art could actually enhance your overall well-being and even inform your practical decisions?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think that's a really interesting point, and it's something I've been trying to figure out lately. I've been feeling like I'm just going through the motions of daily life without any real sense of purpose or direction. Maybe if I could just take some time to explore what brings me joy and fulfillment, I could start to feel more connected to myself and my life.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>As you explore the idea of combining your practical responsibilities with your creative pursuits, I want to acknowledge that it's not uncommon for people to feel overwhelmed and uncertain about how to make that happen. It sounds like you're already taking a great step by recognizing the importance of prioritizing your art, and I'd like to build on that. Research suggests that when we make time for creative activities, it can actually help us feel more grounded and centered, rather than more overwhelmed. What do you think might be the smallest, most manageable step you could take to start prioritizing your art, and how might that affect your overall sense of well-being?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think making a commitment to myself to dedicate at least 30 minutes a week to my art would be a good place to start. It could be as simple as setting aside that time on the weekends or after work, and using that time to create something that brings me joy.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're really looking forward to making some progress and moving forward in your life, and that's really exciting. As you start to prioritize your art, I want to acknowledge that it's okay to take things one step at a time and not put too much pressure on yourself. Research suggests that small, incremental changes can often lead to more sustainable and long-lasting progress than trying to make drastic changes all at once.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think it's really interesting how you're framing the idea of prioritizing my art as a way to enhance my overall well-being and inform my practical decisions. It's like my art is a way for me to communicate with myself and the world around me, and I feel like I've been neglecting that part of myself for a long time. I'm excited to start making some small changes and see where it takes me.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It's fascinating to see how prioritizing your art is already having an impact on your sense of self and identity. Research suggests that when we make time for creative activities, it can actually help us develop a greater sense of self-awareness and compassion. As you continue to explore this new perspective, what do you think would be the most important thing for you to focus on to make sure you're being kind and compassionate towards yourself throughout this process?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think what would be most important for me to focus on is being gentle with myself and acknowledging that it's okay to not have all the answers right away. I've been putting so much pressure on myself to figure everything out and make progress, and I think that's been holding me back. If I can just take things one step at a time and focus on the present moment, I think I'll be able to make more progress and feel more fulfilled.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>As you continue to explore this new perspective on your art and creativity, it's essential to remember that it's a process, and it's okay to take things one step at a time. Research suggests that our brains are wired to respond better to small, manageable changes rather than sudden, drastic ones. By focusing on making small, incremental changes, you can build momentum and confidence, which can lead to more significant shifts in your creative expression and overall well-being. What do you think would be the most challenging part of making small changes, and how can we work together to address those challenges?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think what would be most challenging for me is finding the time and space to dedicate to my art, especially with my busy schedule at the grocery store. I also worry that my art won't be good enough or that people won't like it, which can be discouraging. Additionally, I'm concerned about how my family and friends will react to me pursuing my passion for art, especially if it's not a traditional or conventional career path.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>As you explore the idea of prioritizing your art and creativity, it's understandable that you're worried about the potential challenges that come with it. It's almost as if you're trying to reconcile your practical responsibilities with your desire for creative expression. Can you help me understand what you think would happen if you were to view your art not as a hobby, but as a vital part of your overall well-being and self-care? How might that shift your perspective on the time and space you dedicate to your art?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think if I viewed my art as a vital part of my overall well-being and self-care, I would make more time for it and prioritize it as I would any other essential aspect of my life. I would see it as a way to recharge and refuel, rather than just a hobby or a way to pass the time.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>As you continue to explore this new perspective on your art and creativity, it's clear that you're already taking small steps towards prioritizing your well-being and self-care. Research suggests that when we prioritize creativity and self-expression, it can have a ripple effect on other areas of our life, including our relationships and sense of purpose. Can you help me understand how you think prioritizing your art might impact your relationships with your family and friends, and what steps you might take to share this new perspective with them?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think that by prioritizing my art, I would be able to share a more authentic and creative side of myself with my family and friends, which could lead to deeper and more meaningful connections with them. I've been feeling like I've been hiding this part of myself for so long, and I think that by sharing my art with others, I could build stronger and more genuine relationships.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>As you're recognizing the importance of prioritizing your art and creativity, it's also essential to acknowledge that it's okay to make mistakes and that imperfection is often a catalyst for growth. In fact, research has shown that embracing imperfection can lead to increased creativity, innovation, and resilience. By reframing your mindset around failure and imperfection, you might find that you're more willing to take risks and explore new possibilities in your art and relationships. How do you think you might need to adapt your self-talk and inner dialogue to accommodate this new perspective?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think I've been beating myself up over not being able to make progress towards moving out and being independent, and I've been focusing too much on the negative thoughts and feelings. Maybe if I could just shift my perspective and focus on the small steps I'm taking towards prioritizing my art and creativity, I could start to feel more fulfilled and purposeful. It's like I've been so focused on the end goal that I've forgotten to enjoy the journey and celebrate the small wins along the way.</div>

                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It's common to feel uncertain and unclear about what steps to take when we're trying to navigate a significant change in our priorities. It sounds like you're already taking the first step by acknowledging the importance of prioritizing your art and creativity.
