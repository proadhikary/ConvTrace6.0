                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Hello, William. Thank you for coming today. What brings you here?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>: Hi, thank you for seeing me. I've been feeling a bit down lately, especially since my daughter graduated from college. I guess it's made me think about my age and the things I might not be able to do anymore.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It's not uncommon for people to experience a sense of disorientation and uncertainty when significant life changes occur, and it sounds like your daughter's graduation has triggered some anxiety about your own mortality and potential limitations. Can you help me understand more about what specifically is causing you to feel this way, and what you're worried about not being able to do anymore?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think it's just the realization that I'm not getting any younger, and the things I enjoy doing, like running and snowboarding, might not be feasible for me in the future. It's like I'm constantly thinking about what I'll lose and what I'll no longer be able to do, and it's really bothering me.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It's fascinating how our minds can play tricks on us, isn't it? It's as if our brain is constantly reminding us of all the things that could go wrong, and it can be overwhelming to say the least. Can you tell me more about what you're thinking when these feelings of mortality and loss come up? Are you imagining specific scenarios or thinking about the bigger picture?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah, it's like my brain is constantly replaying these scenarios in my head, showing me all the things I might not be able to do anymore. It's hard to shake off the feeling that I'm losing my physical abilities and that it's just a matter of time before I'm not able to enjoy the things I love. Sometimes, I even imagine what my life would be like if I could no longer run or snowboard, and it's a really scary thought.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It's interesting that you mention feeling like you're losing your sense of control and freedom. Can you help me understand what you mean by that? Is it the feeling that your body is betraying you, or is it more about the sense of independence and autonomy that comes with being able to do the things you love?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think it's a combination of both. I feel like my body is changing, and I'm not in control of that. At the same time, I'm worried about losing the independence and autonomy that comes with being able to do things on my own. It's like I'm constantly thinking about how I'll have to rely on others for things that I used to be able to do myself, and that's a really hard pill to swallow.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It's interesting that you bring up the idea of control and autonomy, as it seems like that's a theme that's been present in many of your concerns about growing older. Can you tell me more about what autonomy means to you, and how you think it might change as you get older?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think autonomy is about having the freedom to make choices and decisions that affect my life, and being able to act on those choices without relying on others. For me, it's about being able to push myself to run or snowboard, and having the physical ability to do so without worrying about getting injured or being held back by my age.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It makes sense that you've been reflecting on the idea of autonomy and freedom, and how it's tied to your sense of self and identity. It's interesting that you're considering how your values and priorities might shift as you age, and how that could impact your sense of autonomy. Can you tell me more about what you think will change, and how you're preparing yourself for those changes?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah, it's like my brain is constantly replaying these scenarios in my head, showing me all the things I might not be able to do anymore. It's hard to shake off the feeling that I'm losing my physical abilities and that it's just a matter of time before I'm not able to enjoy the things I love. Sometimes, I even imagine what my life would be like if I could no longer run or snowboard, and it's a really scary thought.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It's understandable that you're struggling with the idea of losing your physical abilities and autonomy, as it's a significant part of the human experience to grapple with mortality and change. Can you help me understand what you think it would mean for you to still feel in control and autonomous as you age, even if your physical abilities change?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think it would mean finding alternative ways to maintain my sense of autonomy and control, even if it's not through physical activities like running or snowboarding. Maybe it's finding new hobbies or passions that I can still enjoy, or finding ways to stay active and engaged in other ways. It's hard for me to imagine what that would look like right now, but I think it would be important for me to focus on finding ways to maintain my sense of independence and autonomy, even if it's not in the same way that I have now.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're already taking a proactive approach to thinking about this, which is really commendable. Many people struggle to even acknowledge the possibility of change, let alone start thinking about how to adapt and find new ways to stay engaged and autonomous. Can you tell me more about what you think it would mean to you to still feel like you're living life on your own terms, even if your physical abilities change?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think it would be really important for me to have a sense of purpose and meaning in my life, even if my physical abilities change. Maybe it's finding ways to give back to my community or pursuing a new passion that brings me joy and fulfillment. I know it's not the same as being able to run or snowboard, but I think it would be important for me to find ways to stay engaged and connected to the world around me, even if it's in different ways.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're recognizing that your sense of purpose and meaning in life is closely tied to your autonomy and ability to make choices that align with your values and passions. Can you help me understand what you think would happen if you were no longer able to engage in activities that bring you joy and fulfillment, and how you might need to redefine what brings you purpose and meaning in life?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think it would be really tough for me to accept that I'm no longer able to do the things I love, and I'd probably feel a sense of loss and grief. But, I also think that it would be an opportunity for me to discover new things that bring me joy and fulfillment, even if they're not the same as before. It would be a chance for me to redefine what autonomy and independence mean to me, and to find new ways to stay engaged and connected to the world around me.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It's fascinating to see how you're already taking steps towards reimagining your sense of purpose and meaning, even in the face of uncertainty. Can you tell me more about what you think it would mean to find alternative ways to stay engaged and autonomous, and what kinds of activities or passions might spark your sense of joy and fulfillment in a new chapter of your life?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think it's interesting that we're exploring this idea of autonomy and independence, and how it's tied to my sense of self and identity.

                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>As we explore this idea of redefining your sense of purpose and meaning, it's interesting to consider how your values and passions might shift over time. It's not uncommon for people to discover new areas of interest and enthusiasm as they age, and it's possible that you might find a new sense of joy and fulfillment in activities or pursuits you haven't considered before. What do you think would be the most challenging part of letting go of your old identity and creating a new one, and how might you start to explore these new possibilities?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think it's hard for me to imagine letting go of my old identity and embracing a new one, because it feels like a part of me is dying. It's like I'm having to confront the reality that I'm not the same person I used to be, and that's a really tough pill to swallow. I think the most challenging part for me would be finding a new sense of purpose and meaning that feels authentic and fulfilling. It's like I'm having to relearn how to be me, and that's a scary thought.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're struggling to reconcile the person you used to be with the person you're becoming, and that can be a really difficult and uncertain process. Can you help me understand what you think it would mean to let go of your old identity and emerge with a new one that's still authentic to who you are? What are some things that you think you would need to feel supported and empowered during this transition?</div>

                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It's fascinating to me that you're noticing this sense of disconnection between your past and present identities, and I want to acknowledge that it takes a lot of courage to confront this reality. Can you tell me more about what you think is driving this desire to hold onto your old identity, and what you think would happen if you were able to let go of it and allow yourself to emerge with a new one that's more authentic to who you are now?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think that's a great point about finding alternative ways to stay engaged and autonomous. It's like I'm already taking steps towards reimagining my sense of purpose and meaning, even in the face of uncertainty.</div>

                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think it would take a combination of emotional support and practical strategies to help me feel like I'm still in control and autonomous as I age. I would need to feel like I have a sense of purpose and meaning in my life, even if my physical abilities change. This could involve finding new hobbies or passions that bring me joy and fulfillment, or finding ways to stay engaged and connected to the world around me through volunteering or other activities.
