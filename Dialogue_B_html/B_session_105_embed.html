                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Hi Livia, welcome. How are you feeling about being here today?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I guess I'm feeling a bit skeptical. I've tried things like keeping a gratitude journal, but nothing really seems to help. What if this just ends up being another thing that doesn't work?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>I can imagine how demotivating it must feel to try different approaches without seeing any significant changes. Can you help me understand what specifically about the previous strategies didn't work for you? Was there something about the way they were presented or the lack of progress that made it hard for you to stick with them?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I don't know, it just feels like I've tried everything and nothing works. I mean, I was really excited to start the gratitude journal, but after a few days, I just got bored with it. And the other things I've tried, like mindfulness or positive affirmations, just feel so... artificial. It's like I'm trying to force myself to be happy, rather than actually feeling it.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It's interesting that you mention feeling exhausted from trying to force happiness, because I think that's a common experience for many people who are trying to improve their mental well-being. Can you help me understand what you mean by exhaustion? Is it physical, emotional, or a mix of both? And how do you think that exhaustion is impacting your daily life and relationships?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah, it's like my emotions are constantly drained. I feel like I'm running on empty, and it's hard to muster up the energy to do things that used to bring me joy. Even small tasks feel overwhelming, and I find myself procrastinating or avoiding them altogether. It's also affecting my relationships with friends and family, because I'm just not the same person I used to be. I'm more irritable, and I don't have the patience to deal with their problems or listen to their stories like I used to. I feel like I'm just going through the motions, but I'm not really living.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It's as if you're feeling like you're living on autopilot, going through the motions without any sense of purpose or fulfillment. This kind of emotional exhaustion can be really debilitating, and it's no wonder you're struggling to connect with others and feel like yourself. Can you help me understand what you think would need to change in your life or relationships for you to start feeling more like you're truly living again?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah, it's hard for me to even imagine what that would look like right now. I feel like I've lost touch with who I used to be and what I enjoyed doing. I guess I just feel stuck and unsure of how to move forward or even what direction I would want to move in.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're feeling a sense of disconnection from your own desires and values, and that's making it hard for you to envision a future that feels fulfilling. This is actually a really common experience for people who are struggling with negative thinking patterns, because those patterns can be so dominant that they make it hard to remember what we used to enjoy or what we're passionate about.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>It's like I've lost myself in this negative thinking, and I don't know how to get back to who I was before. I feel like I'm just going through the motions, and it's hard to imagine a time when I didn't feel so drained and unhappy.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're feeling like you're stuck in a cycle of disconnection and it's hard to imagine a way out. I can imagine how frustrating and demoralizing that must feel. It's interesting to me that you mention feeling like you're not truly living, like you're just going through the motions. Can you help me understand what you think would need to happen in order for you to start feeling more alive and connected to yourself again?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>It's like, I don't know, I just feel like I'm living in this constant state of uncertainty and fear, and it's hard to imagine anything changing. I feel like I'm just stuck in this rut and I don't know how to get out of it. I guess I'm just hoping that this counseling will somehow magically fix everything, but at the same time, I'm also skeptical that it will really make a difference.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>I can imagine how overwhelming and uncertain it must feel to be stuck in this rut, and to be wondering if anything will ever change. It's like you're carrying the weight of that uncertainty with you all the time, and it's exhausting. Can you help me understand what you think would need to happen for you to feel like you're making progress or moving forward in a positive direction?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think I'm just hoping that this counseling will somehow magically fix everything, but at the same time, I'm also skeptical that it will really make a difference.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>I can really sense your ambivalence around counseling, and it's like you're caught between the hope that it might bring about change and the skepticism that it won't actually work. It's common to feel this way, especially when we're facing challenges that seem insurmountable. What I want to suggest is that our work together might not be about finding a quick fix, but rather about understanding the underlying patterns and habits that are contributing to your feelings of exhaustion and disconnection. By gaining a greater awareness of these patterns, we might be able to identify some small changes that you can make to start moving in a more positive direction.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I guess I just feel like I've been carrying around this weight of uncertainty and fear for so long, and it's hard to imagine anything changing. I keep thinking that if I could just get out of this rut, I might be able to start feeling more alive and connected to myself again. But the problem is, I don't know how to get out of this rut, and it's hard to imagine a way forward.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're already feeling a sense of emotional exhaustion from carrying around this weight, and it's like you're just trying to survive each day without feeling like you're making any progress. Can you help me understand what would make it feel like you're taking a step in the right direction, even if it's just a small one?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think I'm just so used to feeling stuck and uncertain that it's hard for me to imagine anything changing. It's like I've been in this rut for so long that I've lost touch with what it feels like to be happy and fulfilled. I feel like I'm just going through the motions, and it's hard to see a way out of this cycle of negativity and self-doubt.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're feeling really disconnected from your sense of purpose and direction, and that's making it hard to imagine a way forward. Can you help me understand what specific experiences or events in your life might have contributed to this sense of disconnection? I'm not looking for a comprehensive list, but rather just one or two things that stand out to you as particularly significant.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah, I think I can see how my negative thinking patterns have been influenced by my past experiences, especially that difficult life event a few years ago. It's like my mind has been stuck in this perpetual cycle of negativity and self-doubt, and it's hard for me to imagine a way out of it.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Let's break down this significant life event and explore how it's been influencing your thoughts and emotions. It's clear that it's had a profound impact, and it's normal to feel stuck or uncertain about how to move forward. Can you tell me more about what you think you need to do or achieve in order to start feeling like you're making progress, and how you envision that might shift your overall sense of mental well-being?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think I'm just so used to feeling stuck and uncertain that it's hard for me to imagine anything changing. It's like I've been in this rut for so long that I've lost touch with what it feels like to be happy and fulfilled. I feel like I'm just going through the motions, and it's hard to see a way out of this cycle of negativity and self-doubt.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>As you've been carrying this sense of uncertainty and fear for a long time, it's no wonder you're feeling exhausted and disconnected. Can you help me understand what you think is the most overwhelming part of this experience, and how you've been coping with those feelings?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think the most overwhelming part is the feeling of being stuck in this perpetual cycle of negativity and self-doubt. It's like I'm trapped in this never-ending loop of uncertainty and fear, and it's hard for me to imagine a way out of it. I feel like I've lost touch with who I used to be and what I used to enjoy, and it's hard for me to see a way forward.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It makes sense that you're feeling trapped and overwhelmed, and I want to acknowledge that it's okay to feel that way. Sometimes, when we're stuck in a cycle, it can be hard to see a way out. Can you help me understand what you think would be the smallest, most manageable step you could take to start moving in a direction that feels slightly more positive or hopeful? What's one thing you could do, or one change you could make, that would feel like a tiny crack of light in this dark tunnel you're feeling like you're in?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think I need to start by acknowledging that I've been stuck in this cycle of negativity for a long time, and it's not going to change overnight. I need to give myself permission to feel the emotions and not try to force myself to be happy or fulfilled. I also need to start small, like taking a few minutes each day to focus on my breathing and try to let go of some of the negative thoughts. Maybe I can start with that and build from there.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're acknowledging the importance of self-compassion and recognizing that it's okay to not be okay, which is a huge step towards breaking free from the cycle of negativity. By giving yourself permission to feel your emotions and not trying to force happiness, you're already taking a significant step towards building self-awareness and self-care. Can you help me understand what you think would happen if you were to commit to that small step of focusing on your breathing each day, and how it might start to shift your overall sense of mental well-being and relationships?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I'm not sure, but I think it might help me feel a little more grounded and centered. It's like, even though I'm still stuck in this rut, I might be able to find some tiny sense of calm or clarity.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're already taking a important step by acknowledging the importance of self-compassion and recognizing that it's okay to not be okay. By focusing on your breathing and letting go of negative thoughts, you're creating space for a more realistic understanding of yourself and your experiences. This self-awareness can be a powerful catalyst for change, allowing you to develop a more nuanced understanding of what's driving your thoughts and emotions. Can you help me understand how this newfound awareness might start to influence your relationships and interactions with others?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I'm not sure if I'm just being overly optimistic, but I think that if I can find a way to focus on my breathing and let go of some of the negative thoughts, it might give me a sense of clarity or perspective. Maybe it'll help me re-evaluate my priorities and figure out what's truly important to me. I've been so stuck in this rut for so long that I've lost touch with what I used to enjoy or what I'm passionate about. If I can find a way to break free from this cycle of negativity, I think I might be able to start moving in a more positive direction.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>As you start to peel back these layers, it's essential to acknowledge that it's a process that requires patience, kindness, and compassion towards yourself. Can you imagine what it would look like for you to treat yourself with the same gentle understanding that you would offer to a close friend in a similar situation?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I'm not sure. It's hard for me to imagine treating myself with kindness and compassion when I feel like I've failed myself so many times. I'm my own worst critic, and it's hard for me to be gentle with myself.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It's fascinating how this self-criticism can be a deeply ingrained pattern, and yet, it's also a pattern that can be changed. Research has shown that when we practice self-compassion, we're not only kinder to ourselves, but we're also more resilient and better equipped to navigate life's challenges. Would you like to explore some strategies for cultivating self-compassion, such as acknowledging your humanity and imperfections, or perhaps practicing mindfulness and acceptance towards yourself?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think I'm just stuck in this perpetual cycle of negativity and self-doubt.

                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It's interesting that you bring up the idea of taking small steps towards progress, because often it's those small, incremental changes that can add up to make a big difference. Can you tell me more about what you think would make those small steps feel achievable and sustainable for you, and how you might be able to build on them over time?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think what would make those small steps feel achievable and sustainable for me is if I could start by acknowledging that I've been stuck in this cycle of negativity for a long time, and it's not going to change overnight.

And, I think if I could find a way to treat myself with kindness and compassion, it would help me to be more gentle with myself and maybe even start to rebuild some of the connections I've lost with others.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like acknowledging the importance of small, incremental changes is a significant step towards building momentum and moving forward, but it's also clear that you're still feeling stuck and uncertain about what steps to take next. Can you help me understand what you think would need to happen in order for you to start feeling like you're making progress or moving forward in a positive direction?</div>

                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It's interesting to explore this idea of giving yourself permission to feel your emotions, as research has shown that when we suppress or deny our emotions, it can actually lead to increased feelings of anxiety and depression. By acknowledging and accepting your emotions, you're not only taking a step towards building self-awareness but also cultivating a sense of self-compassion. How do you think this might impact your relationships with others, if you were to start practicing self-compassion and acceptance towards yourself?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think that if I can start to acknowledge and accept my emotions, it might help me to stop beating myself up over things that have happened in the past. I've been so focused on trying to change my negative thinking patterns that I haven't really given myself permission to feel the emotions that come with those thoughts. If I can start to allow myself to feel those emotions, I think it might help me to move forward in a more positive direction. And, I think if I can start to treat myself with kindness and compassion, it might help me to rebuild some of the connections I've lost with others.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>As you're recognizing the importance of self-compassion and acknowledging that it's okay to not be okay, it's essential to remember that this awareness is not a one-time achievement, but rather an ongoing process. It's normal to encounter setbacks and difficulties along the way, but by acknowledging these challenges, you can develop a greater sense of resilience and adaptability. What do you think would be the most helpful way for you to cultivate this resilience, and how might you start to incorporate it into your daily life?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>It's hard for me to even imagine what that would look like, to be honest. I feel like I'm so stuck in this rut that I don't know how to even start to move forward. It's like I'm just going through the motions, and it's hard to see a way out of this cycle of negativity and self-doubt.</div>
