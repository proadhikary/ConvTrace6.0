                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Hello Hunter, welcome. How are you feeling today?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>It's just that I can't stop thinking about him. Every time I see a happy couple or something romantic, it brings back all those memories, and it feels like I'm stuck in the past.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're really struggling to shake off those feelings and move forward, and it's completely normal to feel that way. Many people who've experienced a significant breakup can get stuck in nostalgic thoughts and memories, especially when they're triggered by things like romantic scenes or happy couples. Can you tell me more about what you think is driving this obsessive thinking about your ex-boyfriend? Is it a sense of nostalgia, a feeling of unfinished business, or something else entirely?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think it's a mix of everything. Sometimes I feel like I'm just stuck in the past and I can't move forward because I'm still holding onto all these memories and emotions. Other times, I think it's because I feel like I've lost a part of myself when we broke up, and I'm still trying to find that part again. It's hard for me to let go of what we had, even though I know it's not healthy to keep dwelling on it.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It's not uncommon for the grieving process to feel like it's taking up a lot of mental and emotional space, and it sounds like that's exactly what's happening for you. Can you help me understand what you think would need to happen in order for you to feel like you're making progress and moving forward, and how you envision that looking different from where you are now?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>It's hard for me to imagine a specific scenario or event that would magically make me feel like I'm moving forward. I think it's more about learning to live with these feelings and finding ways to manage them so they don't overwhelm me all the time. Maybe it's about finding new ways to cope with my emotions, like journaling or talking to friends, and learning to accept that I might never fully get over him.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>What I want to emphasize is that it's not uncommon for people to struggle with lingering feelings after a breakup, and it's okay to take the time you need to process and come to terms with the end of the relationship. By acknowledging that these emotions are valid and that it's okay to not be okay, you're already taking a huge step towards healing.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I guess I just feel like I'm stuck in this limbo where I'm still holding onto the past, but at the same time, I don't know how to let go of it because it's such a big part of who I am. It's like I'm trying to move forward, but I'm also trying to hold on to these memories and emotions because they're so intense and real to me. I'm not sure how to strike a balance between the two.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're caught in a bit of a tug-of-war between moving forward and holding onto the past, and that can be a really challenging and confusing place to be. Can you help me understand what you think would happen if you were to let go of these memories and emotions, even just a little bit? What do you think you might gain or lose in the process, and how do you think that might impact your sense of self and your ability to move forward?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think if I were to let go of these memories and emotions, I might lose a part of myself that I've been clinging to for so long. It's like these feelings are a big part of who I am right now, and if I were to let them go, I might feel like I'm losing my sense of identity. But at the same time, I know that holding onto them is also holding me back from moving forward and finding new experiences and connections that could bring me joy and fulfillment. It's like I'm stuck between these two opposing forces, and I don't know how to reconcile them.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It makes sense that you're struggling with this sense of identity, given how deeply it's tied to your past relationship. Can you help me understand what you think would happen if you were to find a way to redefine your sense of self in a way that isn't tied to this one relationship? What would that look like in your daily life, and how do you think it might affect your relationships with others, including your family and friends who enjoy cooking with you?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>That's a really tough question, because it feels like my sense of identity is so closely tied to this relationship and these memories. If I were to redefine my sense of self, I feel like I would lose a part of myself that I've known for so long. It's like I'm trying to imagine who I would be without this relationship, and it's hard for me to envision that. At the same time, I know that I can't keep holding onto these feelings and emotions, because they're holding me back from moving forward and finding new experiences and connections that could bring me joy and fulfillment. I think I need to find a way to reconcile these two opposing forces and figure out who I am outside of this relationship.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>I can see how it would be difficult to imagine yourself without this relationship, as it's been such a significant part of your life. It sounds like you're worried about losing a sense of identity and purpose. Can you help me understand what you think would happen if you were to take small steps towards redefining your sense of self, even if it's just in small ways, such as trying new hobbies or spending time with friends who don't have any connection to your ex? How do you think that might help you start to envision a new identity for yourself?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think taking small steps towards redefining my sense of self could be really helpful, but it's scary to think about because it feels like I'm giving up a part of myself. Maybe I could start by trying new things with friends, like trying a new restaurant or taking a cooking class together. It's not about replacing the past, but about finding new experiences and connections that can bring me joy and fulfillment.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>As you explore the idea of integrating your past and present, I want to acknowledge that it's not uncommon for people to feel a sense of disconnection when trying to reconcile multiple aspects of their identity. In fact, research suggests that when we're going through significant life changes, our sense of self can feel like it's in a state of flux, which can be both unsettling and exciting.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I understand what you mean about taking small steps towards redefining my sense of self, but it's still hard for me to imagine who I would be without this relationship. I think I need to find a way to reconcile these two opposing forces and figure out who I am outside of this relationship.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It's interesting that you bring up the idea of creating a ritual or tradition to acknowledge the relationship while moving forward. Can you tell me more about what specific aspects of the relationship you think you might want to honor or acknowledge, and how you envision that process looking for you?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think I want to acknowledge the good times we had and the memories we shared, but also recognize that it's okay to let go of the pain and suffering it caused. Maybe I could create a small ritual, like lighting a candle or writing a letter to the relationship, to symbolize the end of that chapter and the start of a new one. It's not about erasing the past, but about acknowledging its impact and moving forward in a way that honors both the good and the bad.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're grappling with the idea of balancing the need for closure and acknowledgment with the desire to move forward and create new experiences. Can you help me understand what you think would happen if you were to create a ritual or tradition that acknowledges the significance of the relationship, but also allows you to start creating new connections and experiences that bring you joy and fulfillment? How do you think that would impact your sense of self and your ability to move forward?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think creating a ritual or tradition to acknowledge the relationship while moving forward could be really helpful.

                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It's clear that you're torn between honoring the relationship and creating new experiences. I want to acknowledge that it's natural to feel this way, as it's a big transition. By creating a ritual or tradition that acknowledges the significance of the relationship, you're not only processing your emotions but also taking steps towards closure. What do you think would happen if you were to combine your desire to honor the relationship with your need for new experiences? For example, perhaps you could create a ritual that involves cooking a dish that holds special meaning for the two of you, but also includes a new recipe or ingredient that represents your growth and evolution as an individual.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think that's a beautiful idea, combining the honoring of the relationship with new experiences. It would be a way for me to acknowledge the past while also moving forward and creating something new. I could create a ritual where I cook a dish that we used to make together, but also add a new ingredient or twist that represents my growth and evolution as an individual. It would be a way for me to honor the relationship while also acknowledging that I am more than just that one relationship.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>I think what's emerging is that you're recognizing the importance of acknowledging the relationship while also creating space for yourself to grow and evolve. By combining these two elements, you're not only processing your emotions but also taking steps towards closure. Can you help me understand how you think this ritual or tradition would help you integrate the past and the present, and what kind of closure do you think you would feel once you've created it?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think that's exactly what I need to do - find a way to combine honoring the relationship with new experiences. By creating this ritual, I would be acknowledging the past and the memories we shared, but also recognizing that I am more than just that one relationship. It would be a way for me to heal and move forward, while also keeping a part of the relationship with me. I think once I've created this ritual, I would feel a sense of closure and finally be able to let go of the pain and suffering it caused.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>As you explore the idea of ritualizing this process of honoring and letting go, I want to acknowledge that it's not uncommon for people to feel a sense of nostalgia and longing when reflecting on past relationships. It's as if our brains are wired to hold onto memories and emotions, even when they may no longer be serving us. By creating a ritual or tradition that acknowledges the relationship while also allowing you to move forward, you may be able to tap into that natural tendency to hold onto memories and channel it into a positive, growth-oriented experience.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think I'm starting to understand what you mean about finding a balance between honoring the relationship and moving forward. It's like, I don't want to erase the past or forget the good times we had, but I also don't want to be stuck in the past and prevent myself from experiencing new things and growing as a person. Maybe creating a ritual or tradition that acknowledges the relationship in a way that feels meaningful to me, like cooking a dish that holds special meaning, can help me integrate the past and the present and find a sense of closure.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>As you're considering ways to honor the relationship while also moving forward, I want to acknowledge that it's a complex and nuanced process. It's not just about letting go of the past, but also about finding a way to integrate the memories and emotions you've experienced into your present and future. By creating a ritual or tradition that acknowledges the relationship, you're taking a proactive step towards closure and processing your emotions. I'm curious to explore this idea further with you - what do you think would happen if you were to incorporate elements of the relationship into your daily life, not just as a way to hold onto memories, but also as a way to cultivate gratitude and appreciation for the time you shared together?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think that's a really interesting idea, incorporating elements of the relationship into my daily life as a way to cultivate gratitude and appreciation. It's like, I don't want to forget the good times we had, but I also don't want to be stuck in the past and prevent myself from experiencing new things and growing as a person. Maybe I could find ways to incorporate little reminders or symbols of our relationship into my daily routine, like wearing a piece of jewelry or putting up a photo in a special place. That way, I could acknowledge the positive aspects of the relationship while also moving forward and creating new experiences.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're acknowledging the importance of honoring the relationship while also moving forward, and that's a crucial part of the healing process. It's interesting that you bring up the idea of creating a daily ritual or tradition that acknowledges the relationship, because research suggests that rituals and traditions can be powerful tools for processing emotions and finding closure. By incorporating elements of the relationship into your daily life, you may be able to find a sense of balance and closure, rather than getting stuck in the past. What do you think would happen if you were to experiment with different rituals or traditions, such as lighting a candle, writing in a journal, or doing a specific activity that holds meaning for you?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think it's interesting that you bring up the idea of experimenting with different rituals or traditions to process my emotions and find closure. I have tried journaling and talking to friends, but I'm not sure if they've been helping me as much as I thought. Maybe I need to try something different. I've always loved cooking, so maybe I could start a ritual where I cook a dish that holds special meaning for me and the relationship, but also add a new ingredient or twist that represents my growth and evolution as an individual. That way, I could honor the relationship while also acknowledging my own growth and change.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're recognizing the importance of honoring the relationship while also acknowledging your own growth and evolution as an individual. I think it's really brave of you to be considering ways to incorporate elements of the relationship into your daily life, rather than just holding onto memories or getting stuck in the past. By doing so, you're not only processing your emotions but also taking steps towards closure. Can you help me understand what you think would happen if you were to make this ritual a regular part of your routine, and how that might impact your sense of self and your ability to move forward?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think making this ritual a regular part of my routine could be really helpful.

By making this ritual a regular part of your routine, you're not only processing your emotions but also taking steps towards healing and growth. I'd like to build on this idea by exploring how you can make this ritual a mindful and intentional practice, rather than just going through the motions. What do you think about incorporating elements of mindfulness, such as deep breathing or meditation, into your ritual to help you stay present and focused on the emotions you're processing?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think that's a great idea. I've actually been trying to practice mindfulness more regularly, and I've found that it helps me stay present and focused on the emotions I'm feeling. Maybe I could incorporate some deep breathing or meditation into my ritual, like taking a few moments to breathe deeply and focus on the emotions I'm processing before I start cooking. That way, I can make sure I'm staying present and intentional with my emotions, rather than just going through the motions.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>As you explore this ritual, I want to acknowledge that it's not uncommon for people to feel a sense of resistance or discomfort when trying to balance their past and present. It's a natural part of the healing process, and it sounds like you're already taking some important steps towards integration and growth. By incorporating mindfulness practices into your ritual, you may find that you're better able to tolerate the discomfort and ultimately move forward with greater ease. Can you help me understand what you think would happen if you were to commit to this ritual for a set period of time, say 6-8 weeks, and track your progress along the way?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think committing to this ritual for a set period of time could be really helpful. It would give me a sense of structure and consistency, and allow me to track my progress and see how I'm doing along the way. By doing so, I would be able to identify specific patterns or triggers that may be contributing to my feelings of nostalgia and resistance, and develop strategies to work through them. It would also give me a sense of accomplishment and pride knowing that I've been able to stick to the ritual for a certain amount of time.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>As you're considering how to move forward, I want to gently acknowledge that it's normal to feel a sense of emotional whiplash when trying to balance your past and present emotions. It's almost as if your heart is telling you to hold onto the memories and emotions of the relationship, while your mind is nudging you to create a new narrative for yourself. Can you help me understand what kind of ritual or tradition you think would be a meaningful way to honor the relationship while also acknowledging your own growth and evolution as an individual?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think I've been trying to hold onto the past for too long, and it's been holding me back from moving forward. I've been feeling stuck and unsure of how to let go of these memories and emotions. Your suggestion to create a ritual or tradition that acknowledges the relationship while also allowing me to move forward has really resonated with me. I think creating a ritual where I cook a dish that holds special meaning for me and the relationship, but also adds a new ingredient or twist that represents my growth and evolution as an individual, could be a powerful way to honor the relationship while also acknowledging my own growth and change.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>I want to acknowledge that it sounds like you're on the cusp of a major breakthrough, and that's really exciting. By exploring the idea of a ritual that integrates the past and present, you're acknowledging the complexity of your emotions and the importance of honoring the relationship while also moving forward. It's not uncommon for people to struggle with this balance, and it takes a lot of courage to confront it head-on. Can you help me understand what you think would happen if you were to start experimenting with small rituals or traditions that acknowledge the relationship, while also leaving space for new experiences and connections to emerge?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think that's a really important point, and one that I've been struggling with a lot lately.
