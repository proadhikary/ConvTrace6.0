                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Hi Russell, it's nice to meet you. What brings you here today?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I've been stuck as a short order cook for years now, and no matter what I do—whether it's applying to other jobs or going to career workshops—I still feel trapped. It’s really affecting my motivation and happiness.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Can you help me understand what you think would be the most fulfilling career step for you to take, and what's holding you back from taking it?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I'm not sure what the most fulfilling career step would be, but I think I would want to do something that allows me to use my skills and creativity more. As for what's holding me back, I think it's the fear of the unknown and the feeling that I'm not good enough for a better job.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're feeling a sense of discontent and stagnation in your current role, and that's really tough to deal with. Can you help me understand what specifically is driving this desire for creative expression and innovation in your work? Is it the sense of boredom, the lack of challenge, or something else entirely?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think it's a combination of all those things. Sometimes I feel like I'm just going through the motions, and it's not engaging my mind or challenging me to grow as a person. I also feel like I'm not using my creativity to its fullest potential, which can be frustrating. But at the same time, I'm also scared of taking a risk and trying something new, because I'm afraid of failing and ending up in an even worse situation.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It's common to feel stuck and uncertain about the future, especially when it comes to our careers. And it sounds like you're carrying a heavy weight of responsibility on your shoulders, trying to provide for yourself and potentially others. Can you tell me more about what specifically is driving this sense of responsibility and what would happen if you were to take a step back and explore some new possibilities?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think the sense of responsibility comes from feeling like I'm the only one who can take care of myself, and that if I don't do something about my career, I'll be stuck forever. It's like I'm carrying this weight of expectation, not just for myself, but also for others who might be depending on me. If I were to take a step back and explore new possibilities, I'm not sure what would happen, but I imagine it would be scary and uncertain.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It's amazing how often we can get caught up in shoulds and expectations, both our own and others', and how much energy that can drain from us. Can you help me understand what you think would happen if you were to let go of some of that pressure and explore what brings you joy and fulfillment, rather than what you think you should be doing?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think letting go of that pressure would be incredibly freeing, but at the same time, I'm not sure if I'm ready to take that leap. It's like I'm stuck in this mindset of I need to do something about my career and I don't know how to break free from it.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like this pressure to take action on your career has been weighing heavily on you for a while now, and it's no wonder you're feeling stuck and uncertain. Can you tell me more about what specifically is driving this sense of urgency, and is there anything that you're looking forward to or excited about in the near future that might help take some of this pressure off?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think the sense of urgency is mainly driven by my fear of being stuck in this job forever and not being able to provide for myself. I'm also worried about what others might think or say if I don't make any progress in my career. As for what I'm looking forward to, I don't really have anything specific on the horizon, but I do enjoy my free time and hobbies, like playing guitar and hiking.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It's as if you're carrying this weight of expectation, both from yourself and others, and that's making it hard for you to breathe. What if, for just a moment, you could let that weight lift and you could imagine yourself in a scenario where you're fully engaged in an activity that brings you joy and fulfillment? What would that look like, and how would you feel in that moment?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>That sounds like a really nice thought, but I'm not sure if I can truly imagine myself in that scenario. I think I've been so caught up in this mindset of I need to do something about my career that it's hard for me to even consider a different path. But at the same time, the idea of being free from that pressure and being able to pursue something that brings me joy is really appealing.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're carrying a heavy load of expectations, both from yourself and others, and that's making it hard for you to take a step back and breathe. Can you help me understand what you think would happen if you were to start letting go of some of that pressure and allowing yourself to explore what brings you joy and fulfillment, rather than what you think you should be doing?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think if I were to start letting go of the pressure to fix my career, I might feel a sense of relief and freedom, but at the same time, I'm not sure if I'm ready to let go of the responsibility of taking care of myself. It's like I've been carrying this weight of expectation for so long that I'm not sure who I am without it.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like this weight of responsibility has been a significant part of your identity for a long time, and it's natural to feel uncertain about what would happen if you were to let go of it. Can you help me understand what you think would be the most frightening part of letting go of this responsibility, and what do you think you might gain from taking this step?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think what's scaring me the most is the uncertainty of not knowing what would happen if I were to let go of this responsibility. I'm used to being in control of my life, and the thought of not being able to provide for myself is terrifying. But at the same time, I'm starting to realize that maybe I don't have to be responsible for everything and that it's okay to ask for help or support.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It's common to feel overwhelmed by the weight of responsibility, and it's especially challenging when it's been a central part of your identity for a long time. Can you help me understand what you think would be the most important thing for you to focus on in order to start letting go of this burden and finding a more sustainable way to take care of yourself?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I'm starting to realize that maybe I don't have to be responsible for everything and that it's okay to ask for help or support.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>As you acknowledge the importance of learning to let go and ask for help, I wonder what specific situations or areas of your life feel most challenging for you to delegate to others or accept support in?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think what's been challenging for me is letting go of the idea that I need to have all the answers and be in control of everything. I've been so used to being self-sufficient that it's hard for me to imagine relying on others or asking for help. But as I'm starting to realize that I don't have to be responsible for everything, I'm starting to feel a sense of relief and freedom. It's like I'm slowly letting go of this weight of expectation and responsibility, and it's allowing me to breathe again.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>As you're recognizing the importance of learning to let go and ask for help, it's also essential to acknowledge that this shift won't happen overnight. It's a process that requires patience, self-awareness, and a willingness to explore new strategies. Can you help me understand what specific steps you think you might need to take to start building a support network and learning to ask for help when you need it?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think I need to start by identifying people in my life who I trust and feel comfortable reaching out to for support. Maybe I can start by having open and honest conversations with my friends about my feelings and struggles, and see if they're willing to listen and offer help when I need it. Additionally, I can look into local support groups or online communities where I can connect with others who may be going through similar experiences.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>As you start to envision a more supported and collaborative approach to your life, I'm wondering what specific fears or concerns are holding you back from taking those first steps towards building a network of people you can turn to for help?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think I'm still worried about being seen as weak or vulnerable if I ask for help. I've always been the one who's supposed to be strong and independent, and the thought of admitting that I need help is really scary. But at the same time, I'm starting to realize that asking for help is a sign of strength, not weakness.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It's interesting to me that you're recognizing the importance of asking for help and support, and yet you're still holding back because of these deep-seated fears. Can you help me understand how you think others might perceive you if you were to ask for help, and what you think they might think of you if you were to be vulnerable and open about your needs?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think I've been carrying this weight of expectation, not just from myself, but also from others, and it's been exhausting. I'm starting to realize that it's okay to be vulnerable and ask for help, and that it's a sign of strength, not weakness. But, I'm still scared to take that step and let go of the control I've been trying to hold onto.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>As you start to imagine what it would be like to release some of this control and allow yourself to be supported, what do you think would be the most challenging part of that process for you?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think the most challenging part would be letting go of the idea that I need to have all the answers and be in control of everything.

                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're recognizing the importance of asking for help and support, and that's a huge step forward. Can you help me understand what specific situations or areas of your life feel most challenging for you to delegate to others or accept support in, and what might happen if you were to start taking small steps towards building a support network?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think it's going to be difficult for me to let go of the idea that I need to be in control of everything, because I've been carrying that weight for so long. But, at the same time, I'm starting to see that it's okay to ask for help and that it's a sign of strength, not weakness. I'm willing to take small steps towards building a support network, like reaching out to friends and family to talk about my feelings and struggles. I'm also considering joining online communities or support groups to connect with others who may be going through similar experiences.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're recognizing the importance of asking for help and support, and that's a huge step forward. Building on that, I'm curious to explore what specific strategies or tactics you think would be most helpful for you in terms of taking small steps towards building a support network. For example, is there a particular person or group that you've been thinking about reaching out to, or is there a specific activity or hobby that you've been wanting to try but haven't had the confidence to pursue?</div>

I want to reassure you that it's common for people to feel overwhelmed and exhausted when they're shouldering a heavy burden alone. By recognizing this and taking small steps towards building a support network, you're already taking a huge leap towards creating positive change. What do you think would be the most empowering experience for you in this process, and how might that help you move forward in a more fulfilling way?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think it would be empowering to have an open and honest conversation with someone I trust about my feelings and struggles, and to receive support and guidance without judgment. It's like I'm slowly letting go of this weight of expectation and responsibility, and it's allowing me to breathe again.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It's amazing how much progress you've made in acknowledging the importance of asking for help and support.
