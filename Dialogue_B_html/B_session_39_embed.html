                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Hi Julia, thank you for coming in today. How are you feeling right now?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I just feel like I should have done more, you know? Maybe if I had noticed something was wrong earlier, my cat would still be here.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like the weight of what-ifs is really heavy on your mind, and it's natural to feel that way when we experience a significant loss like the one you've gone through. Can you help me understand what specifically you're thinking about when you think about what you could have done differently for your cat, and what's making it difficult for you to shake off this feeling of regret and self-blame?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I don't know, it's just that if I had been more attentive, maybe I could have prevented its death. I keep replaying all the moments in my head, thinking about what I could have done differently, and it's like my mind is stuck on this idea that I'm somehow responsible for its passing.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It's understandable that you're replaying those moments in your head, Julia, as it's a natural part of the grieving process. However, I want to gently encourage you to explore what you're trying to achieve by replaying those moments. Are you hoping to find a way to change the outcome, or is it more about trying to process your emotions and make sense of what happened? By understanding your motivations, we might be able to find alternative ways to help you move forward and find more peace.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I guess I'm trying to find a way to change the outcome, but deep down, I know it's pointless. I just can't help but feel like I failed my cat, and that thought is eating away at me.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>As I'm hearing you talk about feeling like you failed your cat, I'm struck by the depth of your emotional pain and the sense of responsibility you're carrying. Can you help me understand what you mean by I failed my cat? What specific action or decision do you think you took that led to the outcome you're regretting, and how do you think that's connected to your sense of guilt and regret?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>It's just that I didn't notice the signs of illness earlier, and if I had, maybe I could have gotten my cat better care. I feel like my lack of attention and care caused its death.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>I can imagine how the weight of responsibility is sitting heavily on your shoulders, Julia, and it's natural to replay the events in your mind, trying to make sense of what happened. Can you help me understand what you think you would have done differently if you had noticed the signs of illness earlier? Is there something specific that's haunting you, or is it more a general feeling of regret and what ifs?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think I would have taken my cat to the vet sooner, or maybe even changed its diet or environment to prevent the illness from getting worse. But even thinking about those things now, it feels like it's too late, and I'm just stuck in this cycle of regret and self-blame.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It's understandable that you're replaying those moments, trying to make sense of what happened, and it's clear that the weight of responsibility is heavy on your mind. Can you help me understand how you think your cat would have reacted if you had taken it to the vet sooner, or if you had made other changes?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>It's hard to imagine, but I think my cat would have at least had a chance to receive the care it needed, and maybe it could have recovered. But the thing is, even thinking about that now, it's like I'm just trying to blame someone or something else for its death, instead of facing the fact that I failed my cat.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're carrying a heavy emotional load, and that sense of responsibility for your cat's death is weighing heavily on you. Can you help me understand what you think would have happened if you had taken your cat to the vet sooner or made other changes, and how that's related to your sense of failure and regret? Maybe by exploring those thoughts, we can start to untangle the complex emotions and feelings of guilt that are holding you back from moving forward.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>It's like I'm stuck in this constant cycle of self-blame and guilt, replaying the moments in my head, trying to find a way to change the outcome or make sense of what happened. But the more I think about it, the more it feels like I'm just trying to avoid the pain and the truth, instead of really confronting my emotions and the reality of my cat's passing. It's hard to shake off the feeling that I'm somehow responsible for its death, no matter how much I try to convince myself that it's not my fault.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like the weight of your grief and guilt is crushing you, Julia, and it's no wonder you're struggling to come to terms with what's happened. Can you help me understand what you think it would mean to let go of this burden and start moving forward, even just a little bit each day?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>It's hard to even imagine letting go of this burden, because it feels like it's a part of who I am now. I'm not sure I'm ready to give up the idea that I could have done something differently, even though it's obviously not possible.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like holding onto this sense of responsibility and guilt is becoming a way for you to hold onto the relationship you had with your cat, and that it's providing you with a sense of purpose and meaning, even if it's a painful one. Can you help me understand what you think would happen if you were to start to let go of this guilt and start moving forward, even just a little bit each day? What would that look like for you, and what do you think it would feel like?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>It's like, I know I'm not going to be able to change the past, but it's hard for me to accept that I can't go back and do things differently. I feel like I'm stuck in this cycle of self-blame and guilt, and I don't know how to break free from it.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It seems like you're really stuck in this cycle of replaying what happened, trying to find a way to change the outcome, and carrying around this weight of guilt and responsibility. Can you help me understand what you think it would mean to start acknowledging that you did the best you could with the resources you had at the time, and that it's okay to let go of the idea of changing the past?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>It's like, I know intellectually that I did the best I could, but it's hard for me to accept that emotionally. I keep replaying the moments in my head, thinking about what I could have done differently, and it's like my mind is stuck on this idea that I'm somehow responsible for my cat's passing.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It seems like there's a deep sense of longing for a different outcome, and that's making it hard for you to come to terms with the reality of your cat's passing. Can you help me understand what you think would happen if you were to start acknowledging that the past is set in stone and that you did the best you could with the resources you had at the time? What would that look like for you, and what do you think it would feel like to release the weight of that guilt and responsibility?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think I'm just so used to replaying those moments in my head, trying to make sense of what happened, that it's hard for me to imagine a different way of thinking about it. I feel like I've been living in this cycle of self-blame and guilt for so long that it's hard for me to imagine what it would be like to break free from it.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>As I hear you describe the weight of guilt and responsibility you're carrying, I want to acknowledge that it's a common experience for people to feel this way after a significant loss. Research suggests that when we're faced with an unexpected event, our brains are wired to seek understanding and control, and it's natural to replay those moments in our minds, trying to make sense of what happened and what we could have done differently. It's almost as if our minds are trying to rewrite the story, to make it more predictable and controllable. Can you help me understand what you think would happen if you were to start acknowledging that this is a natural part of the grieving process, and that it's okay to not have all the answers?</div>
