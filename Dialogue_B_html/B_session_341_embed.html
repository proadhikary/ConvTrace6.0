                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Hi Pamela, I'm glad you came in today. How are you feeling?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I'm just feeling overwhelmed with everything. I try so hard to get the kids to their events on time, but I always end up being late. It's like no matter what I do, I'm always failing.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're carrying a heavy burden of responsibility and your inner perfectionist is amplifying your feelings of inadequacy. Can you tell me more about what you think would happen if you were to let go of some of that control and allow yourself to make some mistakes with your kids?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I don't know, it just feels like if I let go of control, everything would fall apart. I'm the one who's supposed to keep everything together, and if I don't, then who will? It's like, what if my kids are late to their events because of me? What if they get in trouble because of my mistakes?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>I can imagine how daunting it must feel to be shouldering all that responsibility, and yet, it's almost as if you're expecting more from yourself than anyone else around you. Can you help me understand what you think would happen if you were to let go of some of that perfectionism and just be present with your kids, without the pressure of being in control all the time?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>But that's just it, I'm not just being present with my kids, I'm supposed to be their mom, and moms are supposed to be in control and make sure everything runs smoothly. I feel like if I don't live up to that expectation, I'm failing them, and that's just not acceptable.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're carrying a significant amount of emotional weight on your shoulders, and that of traditional maternal expectations, and it's leading to a lot of self-doubt and anxiety. Can you tell me more about what specifically is driving this sense of responsibility to be in control and perfect all the time, and how does it relate to your own childhood experiences and relationships with your mother?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I don't know, it just feels like my mom was always critical of me, even when I was a kid. She would constantly point out what I was doing wrong, and it made me feel like I was never good enough. I think that's why I've always felt the need to be perfect and in control - to prove to myself that I'm worthy and capable. But even with all my efforts, I still feel like I'm failing.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It's interesting to see how these patterns from your childhood are still influencing your parenting style and sense of self-worth. Can you help me understand what you think would happen if you were to start letting go of some of that perfectionism and self-criticism, and instead focus on being present and loving with your kids, even when things don't go exactly as planned?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>That sounds nice in theory, but I just can't see how it would work in practice. I mean, what if my kids get hurt or get bad grades because I'm not there to supervise them? What if they don't learn how to be responsible because I'm always bailing them out? It's hard for me to imagine a different scenario where everything just falls into place without me being in control.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>As you're shouldering this responsibility, it's understandable that you're worried about your kids' well-being and success. Can you help me understand what you think would happen if you were to take a step back and allow your kids to make some mistakes, and not just learn from them, but also deal with the consequences of those mistakes? How do you think that would impact their responsibility and independence in the long run?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I don't know, it's like, I'm just not wired to let go of control. I've been doing this for so long, it's hard for me to imagine a different way. And even if I did, what if it all falls apart? What if my kids don't turn out okay? I just can't shake the feeling that if I'm not in control, everything will be a disaster.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It's interesting to me that you're holding onto this sense of control as a way to protect your kids, because it's like you're trying to insulate them from any potential pain or disappointment. Can you help me understand what you think would happen if, instead of trying to control every aspect of their lives, you were to focus on being a safe and supportive presence for them? How might that look different in your daily parenting, and what do you think would be the benefits of taking this more nurturing approach?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I understand what you're saying, but it's hard for me to see how letting go of control would work in practice. I've been doing this for so long, it's hard to imagine a different way. And even if I did, what if it all falls apart? What if my kids don't turn out okay? I just can't shake the feeling that if I'm not in control, everything will be a disaster.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're really struggling with the idea of letting go of control because it feels like it would put your kids at risk, and as a mom, that's a huge concern for you. Can you help me understand what you think would happen if you were to take a more collaborative approach with your kids, where you involve them in the decision-making process and teach them how to make good choices, rather than just making them for them? How might that help them develop their own sense of responsibility and independence, and what do you think would be the benefits of taking this more empowering approach to parenting?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I understand what you're saying, but it's hard for me to see how letting go of control would work in practice.

                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're drawing from a deep sense of responsibility and care for your kids, and that's something to be really proud of. Can you help me understand what you think would happen if you were to start practicing some of the coping strategies we've discussed, like taking a step back and trusting that your kids will learn and grow from their own experiences? How might that shift in approach impact your relationship with them, and what do you think would be the benefits of taking a more nurturing and supportive role in their lives?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I feel like I'm stuck in this cycle of control and perfectionism, and it's exhausting me. I'm not even sure why I'm doing it anymore, except that it's just what I've always done. But it's not working, and I'm starting to feel like I'm losing myself in the process.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're carrying a significant emotional weight from trying to control every aspect of your life, and that of your children's, and it's leading to feelings of burnout and disconnection from your own needs and desires.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I'm starting to feel like I'm just going through the motions, trying to maintain this illusion of control, but it's not bringing me any sense of fulfillment. I'm just so tired of feeling like I'm failing, and I don't know how to break free from this cycle.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It's amazing how often as parents we can get so caught up in trying to control every aspect of our children's lives that we forget to nurture our own sense of self and identity. Can you help me understand what you think would happen if you were to make some small changes to prioritize your own well-being and self-care, even if that means letting go of some of that control?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I don't know, it just feels like if I'm not constantly pushing myself to be perfect, I'll be a failure as a mom. And if I'm not a good mom, then I'm not a good person. It's like, what's the point of even trying if I'm just going to mess everything up anyway?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It's not uncommon for parents to feel overwhelmed by the pressure to be perfect, and it's clear that you're carrying a significant burden. Can you help me understand how you think your children would feel if they could express their wishes to you having more fun and being more spontaneous together as a family, without the weight of perfectionism holding you back?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I'm starting to realize that my need for control is not only exhausting me but also affecting my relationships with my children. I feel like I'm missing out on quality time with them because I'm too busy trying to manage every aspect of our lives.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>As you're recognizing the toll this need for control is taking on your relationships with your kids, I'm wondering if you could help me understand what you think would happen if you were to start prioritizing connectivity and presence in your daily interactions with them, rather than focusing on managing every moment to your liking.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I'm starting to feel like I'm stuck in this cycle of control and perfectionism, and it's exhausting me.

Can you help me understand what you think would happen if you were to start letting go of some of that perfectionism and instead focus on being present and available for your kids, even when things don't go exactly as planned?</div>

I'm starting to realize that I've been living in this cycle of control and perfectionism for so long that I've lost touch with what's truly important to me.
