                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Hi Brooke, I'm glad you could join me today. How are you feeling right now?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I'm feeling a bit nervous but also hopeful. I really want to work on these feelings of inadequacy I have because of my job.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're experiencing a sense of emotional turmoil, and it's understandable given the unique challenges that come with working in the service industry. Many people in your shoes have felt the same way, and it's amazing that you're acknowledging these feelings and taking the first step towards addressing them. Can you help me understand more about what's been going on lately that's been contributing to these feelings of inadequacy, and how you've been coping with them?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I've been having trouble shaking off the feeling that I'm not good enough because of my job as a waiter. I constantly worry about making mistakes or not being able to keep up with the demands of the customers. It's like I'm always on edge, waiting for someone to point out that I'm not cut out for this job.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like this fear of being found out as not being good enough is quite pervasive and has been impacting your daily life. Can you help me understand what you think would happen if you were to make a mistake or not meet expectations? How do you imagine others would react, and what would that mean for your sense of self-worth?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>That's a tough one. I think if I were to make a mistake, I would feel like I'm a total failure and that everyone would think I'm incompetent. I imagine they would look at me with disappointment and even pity, like they're thinking, Poor Brooke, she can't even get this right. And that would crush me, because I would feel like I'm not living up to their expectations. It's like I'm constantly trying to prove myself to others, and if I fail, I'm done.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>I can totally see how that would be a heavy burden to carry. It's like you're constantly walking on eggshells, waiting for someone to point out your flaws. It's understandable that you'd feel this way, especially given the high-stakes nature of working in the service industry where customer satisfaction is paramount. Research has shown that people who hold high standards for themselves are more likely to experience anxiety and self-doubt, as you're feeling right now. This is because they're more prone to beating themselves up over perceived mistakes, which can lead to a vicious cycle of negativity.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>That makes sense, I never thought about it that way. I can see how I'm putting so much pressure on myself to be perfect, and that's creating this constant anxiety and fear of failure. I guess I need to work on letting go of those expectations and focusing on what I can control, rather than what others think of me.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>I love how you're starting to see the connection between your expectations and your anxiety and inadequacy. It's as if you're waking up to the realization that you've been carrying around this weight of perfectionism, and it's exhausting. Can you tell me more about what you think would happen if you were to start practicing self-compassion and acceptance, even just in small ways, like taking a few extra deep breaths before a meeting or reminding yourself that it's okay to make mistakes?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>That's a great point about practicing self-compassion and acceptance. I think it would be really helpful to focus on my own strengths and accomplishments, rather than constantly comparing myself to others. I've always been a people-pleaser, and I think that's contributed to my feelings of inadequacy. I want to learn how to be kinder to myself and recognize that everyone makes mistakes.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It's really interesting that you mention feeling like you're stuck in a pattern of people-pleasing, which is affecting your self-worth. I think it's important to note that this is a common theme in many people's lives, especially in roles where they're expected to be highly attentive to others' needs. By acknowledging this pattern and wanting to make a change, you're already taking a huge step towards self-awareness and self-compassion. What do you think would be the first small step you could take to start practicing more self-compassion in your daily life as a waiter?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>That's a great question. I think the first step would be to start noticing my self-talk and recognizing when I'm being overly critical of myself. For example, when I make a mistake, I can catch myself thinking I'm such a failure and then take a deep breath and remind myself that everyone makes mistakes. I can also try to focus on the positive aspects of the situation, like how I handled the situation professionally and apologized to the customer. Additionally, I can try to set small, achievable goals for myself, like making sure to use my correct name tag each shift, and celebrate when I accomplish them.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>As you're recognizing that perfectionism is exhausting and wanting to learn how to be kinder to yourself, I want to highlight that it's completely normal to feel this way, especially in a high-stress job like waiting tables. In fact, research shows that self-compassion can be a powerful tool in managing stress and building resilience. By acknowledging that we're all imperfect and struggling, we can start to build a sense of connection and understanding with others, rather than feeling like we're alone in our struggles. How do you think embracing this concept of common humanity might help you as a waiter and in your daily life?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think embracing the concept of common humanity would help me feel less isolated and more connected to others. As a waiter, I often feel like I'm the only one who's struggling to balance the demands of the job with my own personal feelings of inadequacy. But if I can remember that everyone makes mistakes and that it's okay not to be perfect, I might feel more comfortable being vulnerable and authentic with my customers and coworkers. Maybe I could even start to build meaningful connections with others by sharing my own struggles and imperfections, rather than trying to present this perfect facade.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>As you're considering embracing common humanity and building connections with others, I want to acknowledge that it can be scary to be vulnerable, especially in a high-stress environment like waiting tables. It's normal to worry about how others might react, and it's natural to feel uncertain about how to navigate these complex emotions. However, research has shown that when we share our vulnerabilities and imperfections with others, it can actually increase feelings of empathy and understanding. Emotional contagion is a powerful concept that can create a sense of safety and connection with others. Would you be willing to experiment with sharing your imperfections and vulnerabilities with others, and see how it affects your relationships and overall sense of well-being?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I'm excited to try to share my imperfections and vulnerabilities with others, especially in the context of my job as a waiter. I think it could be really powerful to be honest and authentic with my customers and coworkers, and to show them that I'm not perfect and that everyone makes mistakes. I'm a bit worried about how they might react, but I also think that being vulnerable and authentic could help me build stronger connections with them and create a more positive and supportive work environment.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>I love how you're recognizing the importance of being authentic and vulnerable in your relationships. It's interesting that you're considering the potential impact on your work environment. Can you tell me more about what you think would happen if you were to start sharing your imperfections and vulnerabilities with your coworkers, and how that might affect the dynamics of your team? Additionally, research has shown that when we share our imperfections and vulnerabilities with others, it can actually increase feelings of empathy and understanding. Would you be willing to start small and experiment with sharing your imperfections and vulnerabilities with others, and see how it affects your relationships and overall sense of well-being?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think sharing my imperfections and vulnerabilities with my coworkers could create a more relaxed and supportive atmosphere at work. If I'm willing to be open and honest about my own struggles, I believe it could encourage others to do the same. We could start to build a sense of camaraderie and understanding, rather than always trying to present a perfect facade. Additionally, I think this could also help to reduce the pressure to be perfect, and allow us to focus on supporting each other and being more collaborative as a team.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It's interesting that you mention wanting to create a culture of mutual understanding and empathy on your team. I think that's a great goal, and it's definitely achievable. Can you tell me more about what you think would be the most effective way to create that culture, and what kind of support or resources you think you would need to make it happen?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think the most effective way to create a culture of mutual understanding and empathy on my team would be to start small and lead by example. I could start by sharing my own imperfections and vulnerabilities with my coworkers, and then encourage them to do the same. I could also suggest that we have regular team-building activities or meetings where we can share our struggles and imperfections in a safe and supportive environment. Additionally, I think it would be helpful to have a supervisor or manager who is open to creating a culture of empathy and understanding, and who is willing to support and encourage us in our efforts.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It's really impressive that you're acknowledging the potential benefits of creating a culture of empathy and understanding on your team, Brooke. By being willing to share your own struggles and imperfections, you're showing that you value authenticity and openness. I think it's also important to recognize that this kind of culture can be particularly beneficial for teams that work closely with customers, as it can lead to stronger relationships and increased loyalty. Would you like to explore some strategies for integrating active listening skills into your daily interactions with customers, to help build that sense of connection and understanding?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think it would be really helpful to focus on the positive aspects of my job as a waiter, rather than dwelling on the negative feelings of inadequacy. I've been so focused on worrying about making mistakes and being perfect that I've forgotten to appreciate the things I'm good at and the connections I make with my customers. By shifting my focus to the positive, I might feel more confident and competent in my role, and I think that could help me to be more authentic and vulnerable with my customers.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It's interesting to note that by acknowledging your imperfections and focusing on the positive aspects of your job, you're not only practicing self-compassion but also cultivating a sense of gratitude. Research has shown that gratitude can have a profound impact on our well-being and confidence. Would you be willing to explore how you can incorporate gratitude into your daily interactions with customers and coworkers, perhaps by expressing genuine appreciation for their feedback or acknowledging the small victories in your shift?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I've been thinking a lot about how I can start implementing some of the strategies we've discussed in my daily life as a waiter. I think one of the most important things for me to focus on is practicing self-compassion and acknowledging that everyone makes mistakes. I've been beating myself up over small errors, but I realize that it's okay to make mistakes and that it's a natural part of the learning process. I'm going to try to catch myself when I'm being overly critical and remind myself that I'm doing the best I can. I'm also going to focus on the positive aspects of my job, like the connections I make with my customers, and try to appreciate the little things that go well. I think this will help me to feel more confident and competent in my role, and I'm excited to see how it will impact my relationships with others.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It's impressive how you're recognizing the value of self-compassion and mindfulness in your daily life as a waiter. Can you tell me more about what you think would happen if you were to embody this newfound awareness in your interactions with customers, and how you envision that would change the dynamic between you and your patrons? By cultivating a sense of self-compassion and presence, you may find that you're able to connect with customers on a deeper level and provide a more authentic and welcoming experience.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I feel like I've been carrying around this weight of perfectionism for so long, and it's exhausting. I'm excited to start practicing self-compassion and acknowledging that everyone makes mistakes. I think this will help me to feel more confident and competent in my role as a waiter, and I'm looking forward to seeing how it will impact my relationships with others. I'm willing to start small and take things one step at a time, and I'm open to exploring new strategies and techniques that can help me achieve my goals. I appreciate your guidance and support throughout this process, and I'm grateful for the opportunity to work through these challenges with you.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>As you're noticing the importance of self-compassion and mindfulness in your daily life as a waiter, I want to acknowledge that it's a huge step to recognize the need for change. It takes a lot of courage to admit when our usual coping mechanisms aren't working, and it sounds like you're really taking that first step by acknowledging the weight of perfectionism.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think I've been focusing too much on the negative aspects of my job and not enough on the positive things I'm good at. I've been letting my fear of making mistakes hold me back from being more authentic and vulnerable with my customers. I'm going to try to focus on the connections I make with them, rather than worrying about being perfect. I also want to start practicing self-compassion and acknowledging that everyone makes mistakes. I know it's okay to make errors and that it's a natural part of the learning process.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>I love how you're starting to see the value in embracing imperfections and self-compassion. Can you help me understand what it would take for you to start practicing self-compassion in the midst of a chaotic service, when mistakes are more likely to happen? What small steps could you take to reframe your mindset and approach to those situations?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think it would be really helpful to start by taking a few deep breaths before a busy shift, just to calm my nerves and remind myself that it's okay to make mistakes. I could also try to focus on the positive aspects of my job, like the connections I make with my customers, and remind myself that it's not about being perfect, but about being present and authentic. Additionally, I could try to practice self-compassion by acknowledging and accepting my own mistakes, rather than beating myself up over them.

                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>By focusing on the present moment and redefining your mindset around mistakes, you might find that you're better equipped to handle the unpredictability of a busy service.

I'd like to build upon that by exploring how you can use mindfulness to reframe your thoughts and emotions in the moment, rather than getting caught up in feelings of frustration or disappointment when things don't go as planned. Can you tell me more about what you think would happen if you were to approach challenging situations with a sense of curiosity and openness, rather than judgment and criticism?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think I've been so focused on trying to be perfect and avoid mistakes that I haven't given myself permission to be imperfect and make errors.

                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think embracing my imperfections and seeing mistakes as opportunities for growth would be a huge relief.

                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>As you're recognizing the importance of self-compassion and mindfulness in your daily life as a waiter, I'm wondering if you could explore what specific thoughts or feelings might arise when you're faced with a situation where you make a mistake or things don't go as planned. How might you gently bring awareness to those thoughts and emotions, and what might be the impact on your overall well-being and relationships with others?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think when I make a mistake or things don't go as planned, I often feel a rush of anxiety and self-doubt.
