                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Hello Jessica, welcome to our session today. How are you feeling?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I'm feeling overwhelmed. It seems like no matter what I do, I can't shake the feeling that my bipolar disorder is holding me back at work.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're caught in a cycle where your job performance is affecting your mood and your bipolar disorder is affecting your job performance, creating a sense of stuckness. Can you help me understand what you think are the specific thoughts or self-criticisms that are contributing to this cycle, and how we might work together to challenge those negative thoughts and build more resilience?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Ugh, I don't know why I even bother trying. Nothing seems to work out for me. I just feel like I'm stuck in this rut and I don't know how to get out of it.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It's understandable that you're feeling stuck and frustrated, especially given the challenges of living with bipolar disorder. Your experiences of feeling like nothing works out for you can be really overwhelming and demoralizing. Can you help me understand what you mean by nothing seems to work out for me? Are there specific areas of your life where you're feeling like you're hitting a wall, or is it more of a general feeling that's been present for a while?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah, it's just everything. My work, my family life, my relationships... nothing seems to be going right. I feel like I'm just constantly failing and that's just... ugh, it's just so exhausting.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It's not uncommon for people to feel overwhelmed and like they're failing when they're facing multiple challenges at once. Can you tell me more about what you mean by failing in this sense? Is it a specific area of your life that's causing you the most distress, or is it more of a general feeling that's permeating many areas of your life?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think it's just the feeling that I'm not good enough as a nurse. I keep thinking that my bipolar disorder is causing me to make mistakes and that my colleagues don't trust me. And even though I know it's not true, I just can't shake this feeling that I'm a burden to everyone around me.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It's no wonder you're feeling overwhelmed by these negative thoughts and emotions, given the high stakes of your profession and the added layer of complexity that comes with living with bipolar disorder. Can you help me understand what you think would happen if you were to start reframing your self-criticism and self-doubt as a natural part of the nursing process, rather than a personal failing?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah, it's just so hard for me to believe that anyone would actually want to work with me or trust me as a nurse, given my condition. I feel like I'm just a liability to everyone around me.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>I think it's really important to underscore that your feelings of being a liability to your colleagues and patients are not unique to you, and that many people in the medical profession struggle with similar fears and self-doubts. Can you help me understand what you think would happen if you were to approach your work with a sense of curiosity and experimentation, rather than catastrophizing about the potential consequences of making a mistake?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I guess I just feel like I'm a ticking time bomb, waiting to mess up and let everyone down. It's like I'm constantly walking on eggshells, never knowing when I'll lose my temper or become too spaced out to do my job properly.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>I can imagine how exhausting and terrifying that must feel, always walking on eggshells and feeling like you're one misstep away from making a mistake. Can you help me understand what you think would happen if you were able to shift that narrative and see yourself as a capable and competent nurse, rather than a ticking time bomb waiting to explode?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I don't know, it just feels like no matter how hard I try, I'm always going to be held back by my bipolar disorder. It's like it's just this constant weight that I'm carrying around with me, and I don't know how to get rid of it.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It's interesting how you mention feeling like your bipolar disorder is a constant source of stress and anxiety in your life, and how it's affecting your relationships with colleagues and friends. Can you tell me more about what you mean by getting rid of it? Is it a desire to eliminate the symptoms of your bipolar disorder altogether, or is it more about finding ways to manage it so that it doesn't feel like it's controlling your life?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I know it sounds silly, but sometimes I feel like I'm just pretending to be a nurse, like I'm just going through the motions and waiting for something to go wrong. And when that does happen, I'm convinced that my colleagues will see me for who I really am - a flawed and unreliable nurse. It's like I'm living in this constant state of fear and anxiety, always waiting for the other shoe to drop.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're carrying a heavy emotional load as a nurse, and it's no wonder you're feeling like you're just going through the motions. I want to acknowledge that it takes a lot of courage to be open about your struggles with bipolar disorder and the impact it has on your work. Can you tell me more about what you think would happen if you were to start prioritizing your own well-being and self-compassion, rather than trying to push through your struggles on your own?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I just can't help but wonder if I'm really cut out for this job. I mean, I love being a nurse, but the stress of dealing with my bipolar disorder is just too much to handle. I feel like I'm constantly walking on eggshells, never knowing when I'll lose my temper or become too spaced out to do my job properly. It's exhausting and terrifying, and I don't know how much more I can take.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>I can imagine how overwhelming it must be to feel like you're constantly walking on eggshells, never knowing when you'll lose control or experience a mood shift. It's no wonder you're feeling exhausted and terrified. Can you help me understand what you think would happen if you were to acknowledge and accept your limitations as a nurse, rather than trying to push through and pretend that everything is okay when it's not? What would that look like for you, and what are your fears around doing so?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I feel like acknowledging my limitations as a nurse would mean admitting defeat, and that's something I'm really struggling with. I've always prided myself on being a strong and capable nurse, and the thought of admitting that I need help or that I'm not up to the task is really hard for me.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>I'm struck by how much pressure you're putting on yourself to be perfect, and how that's connected to your sense of identity as a nurse. It's like you're worried that if you admit to needing help or having limitations, that's going to undermine your entire sense of self-worth. Can you help me understand what you think would happen if you were to start exploring what it means to be a nurse who is doing their best, with all of their strengths and limitations, including their bipolar disorder? Research suggests that being open about mental health struggles can actually be a strength, not a weakness, and can even lead to stronger relationships with colleagues and patients.</div>

                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It's common for healthcare professionals to experience emotional exhaustion and feelings of burnout, especially when managing the demands of their work while also navigating personal struggles like bipolar disorder. Can you help me understand what you think would be the first step in making some changes to prioritize your own well-being and reduce feelings of pretence in your role as a nurse?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I don't know, it just feels like no matter what I do, I'm always going to be held back by my bipolar disorder.

                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It's not uncommon for individuals living with bipolar disorder to feel like they're constantly juggling multiple responsibilities, including their work as a nurse, their personal life, and their mental health. Can you help me understand what you think would happen if you were to prioritize your own well-being and self-compassion, rather than trying to push through your struggles on your own? What small steps do you think you could take to start making space for yourself and your own needs?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I'm so tired of feeling like I'm stuck in this rut. I feel like I'm constantly trying to keep up appearances, but deep down, I'm just really struggling to manage my bipolar disorder. It's exhausting and frustrating, and I don't know how much more I can take.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like carrying this secret and trying to maintain a perfect exterior is taking a significant toll on your mental and emotional energy, and you're wondering if there's a way to break free from this cycle without feeling like you're giving up or failing as a nurse.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I just feel like I'm stuck in this perpetual cycle of self-doubt and anxiety, where my feelings of inadequacy as a nurse are constantly reinforced by my perceived failures and mistakes. It's like I'm trapped in this never-ending nightmare, and I don't know how to escape.</div>

Can you help me understand how you think you might be able to start reframing your perceived failures and mistakes as a natural part of the learning process in nursing, rather than as a personal failing? What small steps do you think you could take to start challenging those negative thoughts and reframing them in a more balanced and realistic way?</div>

                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It's not uncommon for nurses to struggle with self-doubt and anxiety, especially when they're working in a high-stress environment like healthcare. In fact, research has shown that nurses are at a higher risk for burnout and compassion fatigue due to the demands of their job.
