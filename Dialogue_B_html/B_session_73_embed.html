                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Hi Michael, welcome. How are you feeling today?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I appreciate you asking. Honestly, the anxiety is consuming me. I keep thinking about how being late even once could ruin my reputation at work and lead to me losing my job. It's hard to focus on anything else right now.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're carrying a heavy burden of anxiety and catastrophic thinking, and it's understandable that it's impacting your daily life. Many people struggle with anxiety, and it's great that you're taking proactive steps to address it. Can you help me understand what you mean by ruining my reputation at work? What specific image or scenario comes to mind when you think about that, and how does that relate to the catastrophic thoughts about being late and losing your job?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>That's a really good question. For me, the image that comes to mind is of my colleagues talking about me behind my back, wondering how someone who is always so meticulous and organized could be so careless and irresponsible. It's like I'm failing at the core of who I am as a researcher, and that's unbearable to me. I feel like if they find out that I'm late once, they'll lose trust in me and start to doubt my abilities.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It seems like this fear of being late and losing your colleagues' trust is deeply entwined with your sense of identity as a meticulous and organized researcher. Can you help me understand how you think being late would specifically impact your relationships with your colleagues, and if there are any potential consequences you're worried about in terms of your research and professional reputation?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think being late would make them question my reliability and trustworthiness. They might start to doubt my ability to meet deadlines, and potentially even question my competence as a researcher. It's not just about being late, it's about me as a person. I feel like my reputation would be tarnished, and that would be devastating to my career.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like the fear of being late and losing your colleagues' trust is a deeply rooted concern that's closely tied to your sense of self-worth and reputation as a researcher. Can you help me understand what you think would happen if your colleagues did question your reliability and competence, and how that would impact your ability to maintain a positive working relationship with them? Additionally, are there any other aspects of your self-concept that you're worried about being threatened or compromised in this situation?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>That's a great question. If my colleagues question my reliability and competence, I think it would affect my ability to collaborate with them effectively. I value their respect and trust, and if that's compromised, I worry that it would be difficult to maintain a positive working relationship. As for other aspects of my self-concept, I'm worried that if I'm seen as unreliable, it would undermine my sense of confidence and self-efficacy as a researcher.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It's interesting that you mention the fear of being seen as unreliable, and I'm wondering if you've had any experiences in the past where you felt like you were really letting someone down because of a mistake or a delay?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>That's a really good question. I think about a project I was working on a few years ago, and I missed a deadline by a day. It was a minor mistake, but my team lead was really unhappy about it, and I felt like I let everyone down. Even though it was a small setback, it still lingers in my mind as a failure, and I worry that if I'm late again, it'll be like reliving that experience all over again.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It seems like this past experience has become a kind of rite of passage for you, a reminder of the high stakes involved in your work as a researcher. How do you think this experience has influenced your self-perception as a reliable and competent team member, and are there any ways in which you've tried to compensate for those feelings of inadequacy in your daily work?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think that experience has made me even more meticulous about meeting deadlines and has fueled my catastrophic thinking about being late. I've started to feel like I'm constantly on edge, waiting for something to go wrong, and it's hard for me to shake the feeling that I'm just one mistake away from failure.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It's interesting to me that you mention being meticulous to prove your capability and competence. I'd like to understand more about what you think others would think of you if you were to make a mistake, and how that perception might differ from your own self-perception as a researcher.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>That's a really insightful question. I think others would view me as careless and irresponsible, like I'm not taking my job seriously. They might think that I'm not as competent as they thought I was. But, for me, it's not just about being careless, it's about being someone who makes mistakes and can learn from them. I'm worried that if I'm seen as someone who can't even meet a deadline, it would undermine my credibility and reputation as a researcher.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like carrying the weight of perfectionism is a heavy burden for you, and it's making it difficult to move forward with your work. Can you help me understand how you think this pressure to be perfect is affecting your overall well-being and relationships with your colleagues? Are there any specific situations or experiences that have led you to feel this intense pressure to perform flawlessly?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think I can see now that my catastrophic thinking is rooted in this fear of being seen as unreliable and incompetent. It's not just about being late, it's about being perceived as someone who can't meet expectations. I'm worried that if I don't meet the standards I've set for myself, I'll lose the respect of my colleagues and that will be devastating to my career.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like this pressure to be perfect has been a lifelong struggle for you, and it's not just about meeting deadlines or avoiding mistakes, but it's deeply tied to your sense of identity and self-worth. Can you help me understand what you think would happen if you were to let go of this need for perfectionism and just focus on being a competent and reliable researcher, rather than being perfect?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think you're right, counselor. I have been carrying this weight of perfectionism for a long time, and it's exhausting. I've been so focused on avoiding mistakes and being seen as perfect that I've forgotten what it means to be a researcher. I'm starting to realize that it's not about being perfect, it's about being competent and reliable. I want to learn to accept that mistakes are a natural part of the process and that it's okay to make them. I want to focus on being the best researcher I can be, rather than trying to be perfect.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're not only feeling the weight of perfectionism but also the pressure to constantly prove yourself to others, which can be a heavy emotional load to carry. Can you help me understand how you think this need for external validation has impacted your sense of self-worth and confidence, especially when you're faced with setbacks or criticism?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think that's a really insightful question. I've been so focused on seeking validation from others that I've forgotten what it means to have self-worth. I've always thought that if I'm not constantly proving myself to others, I'll be seen as inadequate. But now I'm starting to realize that my self-worth should come from within, not from external validation. I want to learn to separate my self-worth from my performance and focus on being a confident and competent researcher, rather than seeking constant affirmation from others.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>As you continue to navigate this complex dynamic, it's essential to recognize that your worth and value as a researcher are not defined by the opinions of others. Remember that perfectionism and the need for external validation are common patterns that can be challenging to break, but acknowledging them is the first step towards making meaningful changes. Let's work together to explore strategies to help you build a sense of self-worth and confidence that's not dependent on external validation, and instead rooted in your own abilities and accomplishments.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think I'm starting to see that my catastrophic thinking is deeply rooted in this fear of being seen as unreliable and incompetent. It's not just about being late, it's about being perceived as someone who can't meet expectations. But what if I were to let go of this need for perfectionism and just focus on being a competent and reliable researcher, rather than being perfect? Would that make me a better researcher, and would it also help me to reduce my anxiety and catastrophic thinking?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It's interesting that you mention being a competent and reliable researcher, and how that would allow you to focus on learning from mistakes rather than avoiding them. Can you help me understand what it would mean for you to prioritize competence and reliability over perfection? How do you think that would impact your relationships with your colleagues and your overall sense of self-worth, especially in the context of research where mistakes are a natural part of the process?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think that's a really great point, counselor. If I were to focus on being a competent and reliable researcher, I would be able to let go of this need for perfectionism and just focus on doing my best work. I would be able to learn from my mistakes and use them as opportunities for growth, rather than beating myself up over them. I think that would not only make me a better researcher, but it would also help me to reduce my anxiety and catastrophic thinking. I would be able to focus on the process of research, rather than the outcome, and that would allow me to be more present and engaged in my work.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>As you continue to explore this idea of prioritizing competence and reliability over perfection, I want to acknowledge that it's not only okay but also necessary to make mistakes and learn from them. In fact, many researchers and experts in your field would agree that mistakes are an inevitable part of the research process, and it's how we respond to those mistakes that matters.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think I'm starting to see that my catastrophic thinking is deeply rooted in this fear of being seen as unreliable and incompetent. It's not just about being late, it's about being perceived as someone who can't meet expectations.

                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>As we explore this idea of prioritizing competence and reliability over perfection, I want to gently challenge the assumption that making mistakes means you're incompetent. Can you help me understand what it is about mistakes that feels so catastrophic to you, and how you think that would change if you were to view them as natural and inevitable parts of the research process?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I appreciate that challenge, counselor. I think what's been bothering me is that I've always associated mistakes with failure, and if I'm seen as making mistakes, it's like I'm failing as a researcher. But now that you're saying that mistakes are a natural part of the process, I'm starting to see that it's not about being perfect, it's about being competent and reliable. If I can learn to view mistakes as opportunities for growth, rather than failures, I think that would help me to reduce my anxiety and catastrophic thinking.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It seems like you're beginning to let go of the need for perfection and embracing the idea that it's okay to make mistakes, even as a researcher. Can you tell me more about what it would mean for you to prioritize progress over perfection in your work, and how that might change your interactions with your colleagues and your overall sense of self-worth? Additionally, I'd like to explore this concept of self-efficacy further and how it might be impacting your confidence and motivation in your research.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think I'm starting to see a connection between my catastrophic thinking and this need for perfectionism.

I want to learn to accept that mistakes are a natural part of the process and that it's okay to make them. I want to focus on being the best researcher I can be, rather than trying to be perfect.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It makes sense that this fear of being seen as unreliable and incompetent has been driving your catastrophic thinking and perfectionism. Research shows that people who have a growth mindset, viewing mistakes as opportunities for growth and learning, tend to be more resilient and less anxious in the face of uncertainty. By reframing your thinking in this way, you may be able to reduce your anxiety and catastrophic thinking, and create a more positive and productive research environment.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think I've been so focused on trying to be perfect that I've forgotten what it means to be a competent and reliable researcher. I've been letting my fear of being seen as unreliable and incompetent dictate my actions, and it's been holding me back from fully embracing the research process. I want to learn to accept that mistakes are a natural part of the process and that it's okay to make them. I want to focus on being the best researcher I can be, rather than trying to be perfect.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It's not uncommon for individuals to struggle with the pressure to be perfect, especially in high-stakes environments like research, where the fear of failure or imperfection can be overwhelming. However, it's essential to recognize that perfectionism is not only unattainable but also unsustainable, and that embracing imperfection can actually lead to greater creative freedom, innovation, and personal growth. Can you help me understand how you think you might be able to cultivate a more balanced approach to your research, one that acknowledges the importance of imperfection and allows you to take risks and learn from mistakes?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think I'm starting to see the connection between my catastrophic thinking and my fear of being seen as unreliable and incompetent.

                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It seems like acknowledging the connection between your catastrophic thinking and fear of being seen as unreliable and incompetent is a significant step towards understanding and addressing the root of your perfectionism. By recognizing that perfectionism is not only unattainable but also unsustainable, you're already taking a crucial step towards embracing imperfection and allowing yourself to take risks and learn from mistakes.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think I've been so focused on trying to be perfect that I've forgotten what it means to be a competent and reliable researcher.

                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It's fascinating to see how your need for perfectionism has become intertwined with your sense of self-worth and confidence as a researcher. It's almost as if you're tied to the idea that if you're not perfect, you're not capable or competent. Can you help me understand how you think this pressure to be perfect has been affecting your mental health and overall well-being?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think that's a really insightful question.

                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It makes sense that you're struggling with the weight of perfectionism and catastrophic thinking, especially given the high stakes of research and the pressure to produce publishable results. It's remarkable that you're starting to recognize the toll it's taking on your relationships and sense of self-worth. Can you help me understand how you envision your research process changing if you were to adopt a more growth-oriented approach, where mistakes are seen as opportunities for growth and learning rather than failures?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think the more I focus on being a competent and reliable researcher, the less anxious I'll feel about making mistakes.

                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>As you explore the connection between your catastrophic thinking and perfectionism, it's interesting to note that many researchers, even those who are highly accomplished, struggle with similar fears of imperfection. In fact, research has shown that the pressure to be perfect can actually hinder creativity and innovation, rather than fostering it. Can you help me understand what you think it would mean for you to reframe your approach to research, focusing on progress rather than perfection, and how that might shift your relationships with your colleagues and your sense of self-worth?</div>
