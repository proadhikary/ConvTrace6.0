                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Hi Riley, welcome. I'm glad you're here today. How are you feeling about this session?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>It's just hard to see how talking about it will help. I mean, Iâ€™ve already tried researching and talking to career coaches, and nothing's changed.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're feeling a sense of frustration and uncertainty about what more talking can do for you, especially when you've already tried other approaches. At the same time, it's possible that there are some underlying emotions or motivations that you've not yet fully acknowledged, which could be contributing to your feelings of dissatisfaction. Can you help me understand what you hope to achieve from our conversations together, and what you think might be missing from your current approach that's preventing you from making progress?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I don't know, I guess I just feel like I'm stuck in this rut and I don't know how to get out of it.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're feeling really uncertain and unclear about what's next for you, and that's a really tough place to be. Can you help me understand what's been the most challenging part of this rut for you so far? Is it the feeling of being stuck, or is it something else entirely?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I don't know, it's just that every time I think I've found a way out, it feels like I'm just going around in circles. I've tried talking to career coaches, researching job options, and even taking breaks from training, but nothing seems to stick. It's like I'm just stuck in this never-ending loop of dissatisfaction and frustration.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're feeling really stuck and uncertain about your future, and that's causing you a lot of distress. Your description of feeling like you're going in circles and not making progress resonates with me, and I want to acknowledge that it's okay to feel that way. It's normal to feel like you're not making progress when you're trying to figure out your future, especially when it feels like everyone around you has their life figured out. Can you tell me more about what you mean by going in circles and what specific thoughts or feelings come up for you when you're feeling like you're not making progress?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think about my friends who have already started their own businesses or are traveling the world, and it feels like they're living the life I want to live. But whenever I try to take a step towards making that happen, it feels like I'm just going through the motions. I'm not really moving forward, and it's frustrating because I know I'm capable of more.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It's understandable that you'd feel like you're stuck in a rut when it seems like everyone around you is living their best life. The illusion of control can be a really powerful force, making it feel like you're just going through the motions without any sense of purpose or direction. Can you help me understand what you think might be the root cause of this feeling, and how it's affecting your daily life and sense of self?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think it's just that I'm not good enough, and that's why I'm not making progress. I feel like I'm stuck in this rut because I'm not capable of achieving what I want. It's like I'm just not good enough to be successful or happy.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like this feeling of not being good enough is a deeply ingrained pattern for you, and it's affecting not just your sense of self-worth but also your daily life and motivation. Can you help me understand what you think would happen if you were to let go of this idea that you're not good enough and just focus on making progress and learning from your experiences, rather than worrying about the outcome?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>It's hard to imagine that I could just let go of this feeling, because it feels so deeply rooted in my self-perception. I've always been someone who strives for perfection, and the idea that I'm not good enough is a constant echo in my mind. It's hard to see how I could silence that voice and start believing in myself.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It's interesting to me that you mention feeling like you're not good enough in relation to your goal of starting your own business. It's almost as if you're taking on this added pressure to be perfect, on top of the already significant challenges of entrepreneurship. Can you help me understand what you think would happen if you were to let go of this need for perfection and instead focus on making progress, even if it's imperfect?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>It's hard to even think about letting go of that feeling, because it's been a part of me for so long. I feel like I've always been driven by the need to be perfect, and it's hard to imagine what it would be like to operate without that pressure. But at the same time, I'm exhausted from feeling like I'm not good enough, and I'm starting to wonder if it's worth it to keep carrying this weight around.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It's interesting to me that you've been carrying this weight of not being good enough for so long, and it's affecting not just your motivation but also your overall well-being. Can you help me understand what you think would happen if you were to start to let go of this weight and focus on progress rather than perfection? What would that look like for you, and how do you think it would affect your daily life?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think it's hard for me to let go of the idea that I'm not good enough because it's been a part of my identity for so long. I've always been driven by the need to be perfect, and it's hard to imagine what it would be like to operate without that pressure. But at the same time, I'm exhausted from feeling like I'm not good enough, and I'm starting to wonder if it's worth it to keep carrying this weight around.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It's interesting that you mention feeling like you're living up to others' expectations rather than your own - can you help me understand what you think would happen if you were to start making choices that are truly in line with your own values and passions, rather than trying to meet someone else's standards?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think it's hard for me to imagine making choices based on my own values and passions because I've always been focused on meeting others' expectations. I feel like I've lost touch with what truly matters to me and what makes me happy. It's scary to think about letting go of this need to be perfect and instead embracing my own imperfections. But at the same time, I'm tired of feeling like I'm just going through the motions and not truly living my life.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're struggling to reconcile the expectations of others with your own desires and values, and that's causing a significant amount of distress for you. Can you tell me more about what you think would happen if you were to start prioritizing your own needs and wants, rather than trying to meet the expectations of others? What do you think would be the benefits of that, and what are some of the fears or concerns that are holding you back from making that shift?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think I've been so focused on trying to make others proud and meet their expectations that I've lost sight of what truly matters to me. I've been living someone else's dream instead of my own, and it's exhausting. I feel like I'm just going through the motions and not truly living my life.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Can you help me understand what specific moments or experiences in your life have led you to feel like you're living someone else's dream instead of your own, and how have they contributed to this sense of disconnection from your true desires and values?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think I've been trying to prove myself to others my whole life, and it's been suffocating me. I feel like I've been living up to everyone else's expectations, but I've never really taken the time to think about what I want for myself. It's like I've been sleepwalking through life, and I'm finally starting to wake up and realize that it's not what I want.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It's interesting to me that you bring up the idea of being kind to yourself, because I think that's a crucial part of starting to prioritize your own needs and desires. Can you help me understand what self-compassion might look like for you, and what small acts of kindness you could practice towards yourself to start cultivating a sense of self-acceptance?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think that's a really good question. I've been so focused on trying to be perfect and meet others' expectations that I've never really taken the time to think about what I want for myself. It's like I've been living in a fog, and I'm only just starting to realize that it's not what I want. I'm scared to think about what I might find if I start to prioritize my own needs and desires, because it might mean that I'm not good enough, or that I'm not worthy of happiness. But at the same time, I'm tired of feeling like I'm just going through the motions and not truly living my life.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>As you explore this idea of prioritizing your own needs and desires, I want to acknowledge that it's a scary and uncertain process. It's natural to feel anxious about what others might think or worry about whether you're making the right decisions. But I also want to remind you that self-compassion is a powerful tool that can help you navigate these feelings. By practicing self-compassion, you can learn to acknowledge and accept your fears and uncertainties, rather than beating yourself up over them. This might look like taking small steps towards self-care, such as taking a relaxing bath or reading a book that brings you joy. It might look like writing yourself a kind letter or having a conversation with a trusted friend or family member. Whatever it looks like, I encourage you to experiment and find what works best for you.</div>

                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you've been carrying around this sense of obligation to meet others' expectations for a long time, and it's been suffocating you. I want to acknowledge that it takes a lot of courage to even acknowledge this feeling, and I'm impressed that you're taking the time to explore what's truly important to you. Can you help me understand what you think would happen if you were to start making choices that align with your own values and passions, even if others don't understand or approve?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I'm feeling really overwhelmed and unsure about what the future holds for me. It's like I'm stuck in this rut and I don't know how to get out of it.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're carrying a significant amount of weight on your shoulders, trying to meet others' expectations and live up to certain standards. It's no wonder you're feeling stuck and uncertain about your future. Can you help me understand what specific messages or advice you've received from others that have contributed to this sense of pressure to perform, and how have they affected your self-perception and decision-making?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>It's hard to even think about moving forward, because it feels like I'm just going to end up right back where I started. I've been trying to make progress for so long, but nothing seems to stick. I'm starting to wonder if I'm just fooling myself into thinking that I can make a change, and that I'll just end up back in the same place again.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're carrying a heavy burden of self-doubt and fear, and it's making it hard for you to take any steps towards moving forward. Your fear of ending up right back where you started is a very real and understandable concern, but I want to acknowledge that you're not alone in feeling this way. Many people struggle with self-doubt and fear when it comes to making changes in their lives, and it's often a normal part of the process. Can you help me understand what you think would happen if you were to start to let go of this fear and take small, incremental steps towards making progress, even if it feels uncertain or scary? What would that look like for you, and how do you think it would affect your sense of self and your overall well-being?</div>

                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're feeling really trapped by the pressure to meet others' expectations, and that's making it hard for you to imagine a future that's authentic to who you are. Can you help me understand what you think would happen if you were to start to separate your own desires and values from the expectations of others? What would that look like for you, and how do you think it would affect your sense of self and your overall well-being?</div>
