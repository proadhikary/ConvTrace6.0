                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Good morning, Nancy. I'm glad you're here today. To start, could you tell me a bit about what's been going on for you recently?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I've been feeling like I'm not as good of a teacher as my colleagues. Even when students give me positive feedback, I can't shake the feeling that I'm just not measuring up. It's been affecting my confidence a lot, especially in the classroom.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like this sense of self-doubt has been lingering for a while, and it's starting to affect your relationships with your students and colleagues. Can you help me understand what you think would happen if you were to start to let go of some of this self-criticism and focus more on the positive aspects of your teaching and the impact you're having on your students?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I don't know... it's hard for me to imagine a situation where I wouldn't be constantly worried about not being good enough. It's just so ingrained in me at this point. And even if I did try to focus on the positive, I'm sure I'd just end up beating myself up over some minor mistake I made in class.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It's fascinating to me how this pattern of self-criticism has developed for you, Nancy, and how it's become so deeply ingrained. Can you help me understand what you think would happen if you were to make a mistake, even a small one, and instead of beating yourself up over it, you simply acknowledged it and moved on? How do you think that would affect your overall sense of well-being and confidence in the classroom?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I don't know if I can really do that. It's like, what's the point of even trying if I'm just going to mess up anyway? And besides, my colleagues are always so perfect, I just can't compete with that.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It's interesting to me that you're holding yourself to such high standards, Nancy, and that this fear of not meeting those standards is affecting your confidence and motivation. Can you tell me more about what you think would happen if you were to let go of this need to be perfect and just focus on doing your best?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I don't see how I can let go of this need to be perfect, it's just who I am. And even if I did, I'm sure my colleagues would just laugh at me behind my back, they're always so critical of each other.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It's understandable that you feel this way, Nancy, given the high-value you place on perfection and the fear of being judged by others. Research has shown that perfectionism can actually be a coping mechanism for people who feel a lack of control or power in their lives. Would you like to explore how this might be connected to your own experiences and what it's trying to protect you from?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I don't know, it all just feels like a never-ending cycle of self-doubt and criticism. I'm not even sure why I'm here, I just thought it would be a waste of time to try to change, but I guess I'm still hoping that somehow, someway, things will get better.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're carrying around a heavy burden of self-doubt and criticism, and it's been a long-standing pattern that's really taking a toll on your well-being. Can you help me understand what you think would happen if you were to start to challenge some of these negative thoughts and start practicing self-compassion, rather than being so harshly critical towards yourself? How do you think that would impact your relationships with your students and colleagues, and overall sense of confidence and job satisfaction?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I don't know, it all just feels like a never-ending cycle of self-doubt and criticism.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Nancy, it's interesting to me that you're acknowledging the pattern of self-doubt and criticism, but also feeling stuck in it. Can you help me understand what you think would need to happen for you to start to break free from this cycle and develop a more compassionate relationship with yourself?</div>

                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like this self-criticism has been a part of your life for a long time, and it's hard to imagine breaking free from it. I want to acknowledge that it's not uncommon for people to struggle with self-doubt and criticism, especially when they're used to being hard on themselves. Understanding that you're not alone in this struggle might be helpful. Additionally, becoming more aware of the thoughts and feelings that trigger this self-criticism could be a good starting point for making some changes. Would you be willing to explore what might be driving this need for perfection and self-criticism, and how it might be connected to your experiences in the past?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I feel like I'm stuck in this cycle of self-doubt and criticism, and I don't know how to break free from it. It's like, I'm constantly worried about not being good enough, and even when I do get positive feedback, I just can't shake the feeling that I'm not measuring up. It's exhausting, and I don't know how much more of it I can take.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like this cycle of self-doubt and criticism has become so deeply ingrained that it's affecting not just your sense of self-worth but also your overall well-being. Research has shown that chronic self-criticism can lead to increased stress, anxiety, and depression. Can you help me understand what you think would happen if you were to start to challenge some of these negative thoughts and focus on building self-compassion instead?</div>

I want to acknowledge that it's not uncommon for people to struggle with self-criticism, especially when it comes to their work or accomplishments. In fact, research has shown that chronic self-criticism can lead to increased stress, anxiety, and depression. Understanding that you're not alone in this struggle and that there is hope for change might be a valuable first step. Can you help me understand what you think would happen if you were to start to challenge some of these negative thoughts and focus on building self-compassion instead of self-criticism?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I wish I could just switch off this self-criticism, but it feels like it's always there, lurking in the background, waiting to pounce and make me feel terrible about myself. I guess I'm just worried that if I let my guard down, I'll make a mistake and then I'll be even more disappointed in myself.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It's interesting that you mention perfectionism and the fear of making mistakes, Nancy. I think it's worth exploring how those dynamics might be playing out in your life right now. Can you help me understand what you think would happen if you were to let go of the need for perfection and instead focus on learning from your mistakes? How do you think that might impact your relationships with your students and colleagues, and what would that look like for you in terms of your daily interactions with them?</div>

                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It's fascinating to me, Nancy, that you've been able to identify the negative thought patterns and the emotions that come with them, and yet, it's still challenging to break free from this cycle of self-doubt and criticism. Can you help me understand what you think would happen if you were to start to challenge these negative thoughts and replace them with more balanced and compassionate ones towards yourself? How do you think that would impact your relationships with your students and colleagues, and overall sense of confidence and job satisfaction?</div>

                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like this self-criticism is not only affecting your personal well-being but also impacting your relationships and daily interactions. I'd like to explore this further. Can you help me understand what you think your colleagues and students would say if they could express their feelings about your self-criticism? How do you think they would describe your strengths and accomplishments, and what do you think would be some potential benefits of sharing those with yourself?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I'm not sure what to say. It's like, I've always been so focused on what I'm doing wrong that I haven't really thought about what I'm doing right. But now that you mention it, I guess that's not true. I have received positive feedback from students and colleagues, and I've accomplished some things that I'm proud of. But why does it feel like that's not enough? Why can't I just be okay with being good at something without having to constantly worry about not being perfect?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're recognizing the importance of acknowledging and accepting your strengths and accomplishments, rather than constantly focusing on your perceived flaws.

                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It's common for people to get stuck in this cycle of self-criticism, and it's often rooted in a desire to be in control or to meet others' expectations. Can you help me understand how you think your self-concept would shift if you were to start focusing on your strengths and accomplishments, rather than dwelling on your perceived flaws?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I'm getting a bit frustrated with this process, to be honest.
