                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Hi Jessica, I'm glad you could make it today. How are you feeling right now?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I've been feeling overwhelmed at work, especially with the added pressure of my bipolar disorder. It's making me second-guess my abilities and whether I can handle my responsibilities as a nurse.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It makes sense that the added pressure of your job, combined with the challenges of living with bipolar disorder, would be causing you to feel uncertain about your abilities as a nurse. Can you help me understand how you've been coping with these feelings of self-doubt and uncertainty, and what you think would help you regain your confidence in your work?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>It's tough to really pinpoint what's been helping me cope, but I think just talking to my colleagues and trying to adjust my work schedule have been somewhat effective. As for regaining my confidence, I'm not really sure. I feel like my bipolar disorder is a major factor in my self-doubt, so I'm not sure if there's anything that can be done to overcome that.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It's clear that you're really struggling to find ways to overcome the self-doubt that's been impacting your work performance, and it's understandable that you're feeling uncertain about your abilities as a nurse given your experiences with bipolar disorder. Can you tell me more about what you think is happening when you feel overwhelmed and struggling with self-doubt, and how does that impact your ability to provide care to your patients?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Honestly, it's hard for me to even think about my patients when I'm feeling so uncertain about my own abilities. It's like my self-doubt is a constant noise in the background, making it hard for me to focus on anything else.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It's not uncommon for self-doubt to creep in and affect our ability to focus on what's most important, especially in high-stress professions like nursing. Can you help me understand what you think would be the most helpful step you could take right now to quiet that self-doubt and refocus on your patients' needs?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think I need to work on building my confidence as a nurse, but I'm not sure how to do that while also acknowledging my bipolar disorder. It's like, I don't want to pretend like I'm more capable than I am, but at the same time, I don't want my self-doubt to hold me back from doing my job to the best of my ability.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're carrying a heavy weight of responsibility as a nurse, and acknowledging your limitations with bipolar disorder can be a daunting task. It's understandable that you're worried about being perceived as vulnerable or weak by your colleagues or patients. Can you tell me more about what you think would happen if you were to be more open and honest about your struggles with self-doubt and bipolar disorder, and how you might be able to use realistic optimism to reframe your thinking and build confidence in your abilities as a nurse?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I'm not sure what would happen if I were more open and honest about my struggles with self-doubt and bipolar disorder. I'm worried that my colleagues and patients would think less of me or view me as weak. On the other hand, I also think that being more open and honest could actually help me build trust with others and create a sense of community. It's hard for me to imagine a scenario where being vulnerable would be beneficial, but I know it's something that I need to work on.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It's interesting that you're considering the potential benefits of being more open and honest about your struggles, and I want to acknowledge that it's a big step to take. Can you tell me more about what motivates you to want to share your experiences, and how you think that might help you build stronger relationships with your colleagues and patients? Additionally, I'd like to share with you that research has shown that people who are open and honest about their mental health struggles, including bipolar disorder, are actually more likely to receive support and understanding from others. Would you like to explore some strategies for how you could start to share your experiences in a way that feels authentic and empowering for you?</div>

                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're already doing some incredible work as a nurse, and yet you're still struggling to find that balance between being authentic and confident. Can you tell me more about what's driving your desire to be more confident in your abilities, and what you think would happen if you were to be more open about your struggles with bipolar disorder?</div>

It's understandable that you're hesitant to open up about your struggles with self-doubt and bipolar disorder, given the potential risks of being judged or perceived as vulnerable. However, research suggests that people who are open and honest about their mental health struggles are actually more likely to receive support and understanding from others. Would you be willing to explore some strategies for how you could start to share your experiences in a way that feels authentic and empowering for you, and what would be some potential benefits of doing so?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think it's scary to be vulnerable and open about my struggles with self-doubt and bipolar disorder, but at the same time, I know it's something I need to work on.

                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It's interesting that you bring up the idea of starting small by sharing your experiences with a trusted colleague or friend. Can you help me understand what you think would be the most important qualities in someone who you would trust to share your struggles with, and how you envision that conversation playing out?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I'm feeling overwhelmed by the pressure to be perfect as a nurse, and my bipolar disorder is definitely a factor in my self-doubt. I'm worried that if I open up about my struggles, my colleagues and patients will think less of me or view me as weak. But at the same time, I know that being more open and honest could actually help me build trust with others and create a sense of community.

                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>I'm hearing that you're worried about being perceived as vulnerable or weak by your colleagues and patients, and that's a really common concern, especially in a profession like nursing where there's a high level of expectations and responsibility. Can you help me understand what you think would be the most important thing for you to focus on in order to feel more confident and authentic in your role as a nurse, while also being honest about your struggles with bipolar disorder?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think that's the hardest part for me - feeling like I have to be perfect as a nurse, and my bipolar disorder is just another thing on top of that. It's like, I'm already worried about making mistakes and not being good enough, and then I have to add this extra layer of self-doubt because of my mental health.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like carrying the weight of perfectionism as a nurse, on top of managing your bipolar disorder, is taking a significant toll on your emotional well-being. It's interesting that you bring up the idea of being authentic and vulnerable in your role - can you tell me more about what that might look like for you, and how you think it could positively impact your relationships with patients and colleagues? Additionally, I'd like to share some insights on how reframing perfectionism can help reduce feelings of self-doubt and anxiety, and we can explore some strategies together to achieve that.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think I've been trying to approach my struggles with self-doubt and bipolar disorder in a very perfectionistic way, where I'm constantly worried about being seen as weak or vulnerable by my colleagues and patients. But I'm starting to realize that being authentic and open about my struggles could actually be a strength, not a weakness. It's scary to think about being vulnerable, but I'm willing to take small steps towards being more open and honest, like sharing my experiences with a trusted colleague or friend.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>As you've shared, being authentic and open about your struggles with self-doubt and bipolar disorder could be a powerful way to build connections with others and find support. I'd like to build on that idea by sharing that many people in high-stress professions like nursing often struggle with the pressure to be perfect, and it can be incredibly liberating to acknowledge that it's okay to not have all the answers. Would you be open to exploring ways to reframe your thinking around self-doubt and perfectionism, perhaps by challenging some of those unrealistic expectations and focusing on what you can control?</div>
