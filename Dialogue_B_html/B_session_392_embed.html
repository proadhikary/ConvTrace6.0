                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Hi Kyle, it's nice to meet you. What brings you in today?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I always assume they will say no, and it just feels pointless to even try.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like this fear of rejection has been a persistent pattern in your relationships, making it hard for you to take the leap and express your feelings. Can you help me understand what you think might happen if you were to take a different approach, one where you focus on the potential benefits of connection and intimacy rather than the fear of rejection?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I don't know, it's just hard for me to imagine a situation where someone would actually say yes. It feels like I'm just setting myself up for disappointment.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like this pattern of thinking is really ingrained for you, Kyle, and it's making it tough to imagine a different outcome. Can you tell me more about what you think would happen if you were to challenge this assumption and actually take a risk on someone saying yes? What would that look like for you, and how do you think it would feel?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I guess it would feel like I'm being ridiculous and foolish for even trying. It's like, what's the point of putting myself out there when I'm just going to get rejected anyway? And even if I did get someone to say yes, it wouldn't last because everyone's just looking for something better, you know? It's a waste of time.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It's as if you're carrying this weight of disappointment and frustration, and it's hard to imagine taking a chance and getting hurt again. I'm wondering, can you help me understand what you think would happen if you were to take a small step towards connecting with someone, without the pressure of trying to make it last forever? Maybe just focus on the moment, and see where it takes you?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I don't know, it just feels like I'm setting myself up for failure. Even if I did take that step, I'm sure I'd just get hurt in the end. It's just easier to avoid it all together and not get my hopes up.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're carrying a heavy emotional burden from past experiences, and it's making it tough for you to even consider the possibility of genuine connection with others. Can you help me understand what you think is the root of this feeling of being set up for failure? Is it the fear of getting hurt again, or is it something else entirely?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I guess it's just the fear of getting hurt again. It's like, I've been burned before, and I don't want to go through that again. It's hard for me to trust that someone would actually care about me or be interested in me for who I am, rather than just using me for their own gain.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It's no wonder you're feeling this way, Kyle, given the experiences you've had in the past. It's like your heart is carrying around a heavy load of uncertainty and doubt, making it hard for you to trust others or even yourself. Can you tell me more about what you think would happen if you were to take a small step towards someone, like making a friendly comment or asking for their help, and see how they respond? Might it be possible to challenge this fear of being used or rejected by experiencing something more positive and genuine?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I don't know, it just feels like I'm setting myself up for failure. Even if I did take that step, I'm sure I'd just get hurt in the end. It's just easier to avoid it all together and not get my hopes up.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It's interesting to me that you seem to be stuck in this cycle of avoiding rejection, and it's affecting your ability to form meaningful connections with others. Can you help me understand what you think would happen if you were to take a small risk and open up to someone about your feelings, rather than just focusing on avoiding rejection?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I understand that you're trying to help me, but it's just hard for me to see a way out of this pattern of thinking. It feels like I've been stuck in this cycle of fear and rejection for so long that I don't know how to break free from it.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>As you've shared, it feels like you're caught in a cycle of fear and rejection, and it's hard to imagine a way out of it. I want to acknowledge that it's not uncommon for people to feel stuck in patterns that feel overwhelming and difficult to change. In fact, research suggests that many of our behaviors and thoughts are automatically triggered by certain cues, making it challenging to break free from them. But what if, together, we could identify some of these triggers and start to work on reframing your responses to them? Would you be willing to explore that further?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I don't know, it feels like no matter what I do, I'll always end up getting hurt or rejected. And even if I did take a chance and get someone to say yes, it wouldn't mean anything because they'd probably just be using me for their own reasons. It's like, what's the point of even trying?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like this feeling of being used or disconnected from others has been a really common experience for you, and it's hard for you to imagine that people might be genuinely interested in getting to know you for who you are. Can you help me understand what you think would happen if you were to challenge this assumption and take a risk on someone saying yes, not because they're trying to use you, but because they're actually drawn to you?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I understand what you're saying, but it's hard for me to shake off the feeling that I'm just setting myself up for failure. It's like, I've been burned before, and I don't want to go through that again. I know you're trying to help me, but it's just hard for me to trust that people would actually care about me or be interested in me for who I am, rather than just using me for their own gain.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like this feeling of being stuck in a pattern of fear and rejection is not only affecting your relationships but also your sense of self-worth. Can you help me understand how you think this pattern is impacting your daily life and overall well-being, and what you think would be a more fulfilling life for you if you weren't held back by this fear?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I guess I've just been so focused on avoiding rejection that I haven't really thought about what I would want out of a relationship or what kind of connections I would make with others. It's like, I've been so busy trying to avoid getting hurt that I haven't really considered what I would want to get out of it.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It's like you're carrying this weight of uncertainty and doubt about your own worthiness of connection and intimacy, and it's making it hard for you to even imagine what you would want out of a relationship. Can you help me understand what you think would happen if you were to let go of this fear of rejection and just focus on what you want to experience in a relationship, rather than what you're trying to avoid?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>It's just hard for me to imagine that anyone would actually care about me or be interested in me for who I am, rather than just using me for their own gain. I don't know how to break free from this cycle of fear and rejection, and it's hard for me to trust that people would actually be genuine in their interest.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>As you've shared, it's clear that this fear of rejection has been a deeply ingrained pattern in your relationships, and it's affecting not only your connections with others but also your sense of self-worth. Can you help me understand how you think this pattern started in the first place? Was there a specific event or experience that triggered this fear, or do you think it's something that's been building up over time?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think my fear of rejection started when I was younger, maybe around 12 or 13. I had a crush on a girl in my class, and I mustered up the courage to ask her out. She rejected me, and it felt like the whole world had come crashing down. After that, I just felt like I was never good enough, that I was always going to be rejected. It's like, I've been carrying that feeling around with me ever since, and it's hard for me to shake it off.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It makes sense that the rejection you experienced as a young teenager has had a lasting impact on your sense of self-worth and ability to take risks in relationships. Many people struggle with feelings of inadequacy and low self-esteem after being rejected, and it's not uncommon for these feelings to linger well into adulthood. Can you help me understand what you think would happen if you were to reframe that rejection in a more positive light, rather than seeing it as a reflection of your worth as a person? Maybe we can explore some ways to rewire your thinking around that experience and how it's influenced your relationships since then.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>It's like, I've been carrying that feeling around with me ever since, and it's hard for me to shake it off. I think that rejection has just been a constant reminder that I'm not good enough, that I'm always going to be rejected. It's hard for me to even imagine a situation where someone would actually say yes to me.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It's interesting to me that you've been carrying around this feeling of not being good enough for so long, and it's affecting your ability to take risks and connect with others. Can you tell me more about what you think would happen if you were to start to challenge this idea that your worth is tied to other people's opinions or actions? Maybe we can explore some ways to reframe your self-talk and start to focus on building your own sense of self-worth, rather than seeking validation from others?</div>

Can you help me understand what you think would happen if you were to start to challenge this fear by taking small steps towards connection with someone, like making eye contact or starting a conversation?

I'm wondering if we can explore what you think is the underlying message you're giving to others when you're being cautious in relationships. Are you essentially saying, I'm not worthy of love or connection, or is it more like, I'm not sure how to navigate relationships and trust others?</div>
