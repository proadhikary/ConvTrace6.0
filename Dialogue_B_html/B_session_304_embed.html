                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Hello, Leonard. It's nice to meet you. How have you been feeling lately?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I've been feeling kind of down recently. I often feel like I'm a bad grandson, especially when my grandpa doesn't act how I expect him to.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're carrying around a lot of responsibility and pressure to meet your grandparents' expectations, and that's causing you a lot of distress. Can you help me understand more about what you think it would mean to be a good grandson, and how you think you're measuring up to that standard?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah, I guess I do feel like I'm supposed to be a certain way, like I'm supposed to make them proud. But when my grandpa doesn't take me to get ice cream, it feels like I've failed or something.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It's understandable that you'd feel like you're walking on eggshells around your grandparents, especially since you've noticed that even small things can set them off. Can you help me understand what you think would happen if you were to relax a bit and just be yourself around them, without trying to meet their expectations?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>That's a tough one. I guess I'm scared that if I'm not perfect, they'll be disappointed in me and won't want to spend time with me anymore. It's hard for me to imagine them loving me for who I am, rather than for what I do.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're carrying a lot of weight on your shoulders, trying to balance your own desires with your fear of disappointing your grandparents. Can you tell me more about what you think would happen if you were to let go of that pressure and just focus on being yourself around them, without trying to be a certain way? How do you think that would affect your relationships with them?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>It's hard to imagine not trying to please my grandpa because I've always done that to feel loved and accepted. But I guess if I could let go of the need for their approval, I might feel more relaxed and comfortable around them. Maybe I could even find ways to connect with them that don't involve ice cream or other activities they traditionally do together.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It's interesting to see how this dynamic has been playing out, and how it's affecting your sense of identity and self-worth. Can you help me understand what you think would happen if you were to start exploring these alternative ways of connecting with your grandparents, and how that might impact your feelings of obligation and pressure to please them?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>That's a good point, I never thought about it that way. I've been so focused on trying to meet their expectations that I haven't considered what it would be like to have a different kind of relationship with them.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're starting to recognize the weight of responsibility you've been carrying around, and that's a big step. Can you tell me more about what you think it would mean to start exploring these alternative ways of connecting with your grandparents, and what kind of support you might need to take those first steps?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah, I guess I do feel like I'm supposed to be a certain way, like I'm supposed to make them proud. But when my grandpa doesn't take me to get ice cream, it feels like I've failed or something.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It's as if you're carrying around this weight of responsibility to make your grandparents proud, and it's affecting even the small moments you share with them, like going for ice cream. Can you help me understand what you think would happen if you were to start exploring what you enjoy about spending time with your grandparents, rather than focusing on whether you're meeting their expectations?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think I've been so focused on trying to be a good grandson that I haven't stopped to think about what I actually enjoy about spending time with them. Maybe if I start looking at it from a different perspective, I can find ways to connect with them that feel more authentic and less like I'm trying to please them.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It's interesting to see how this awareness is starting to shift your perspective on your relationship with your grandparents. Can you help me understand what you think would be the most challenging part for you in starting to explore your own interests and desires in this relationship, and how you might address those challenges?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think what's been holding me back is the fear of being rejected or not being loved for who I am. It's hard for me to imagine that my grandparents would still love me even if I'm not perfect, and that's what's been driving my need to please them all the time.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It's understandable that you'd feel this way, given the high value you've placed on their approval and love. Can you help me understand what you think would happen if you were to start testing this assumption, even just a little bit? For example, would you be willing to take a small risk and do something that might not align with their expectations, but still comes from a place of authenticity and self-love?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think I've been so focused on trying to be a good grandson that I haven't stopped to think about what I actually enjoy about spending time with them.

                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>As you start to imagine what it would be like to take small steps towards self-love and authenticity in your relationship with your grandparents, I want to acknowledge that it can be scary to let go of the need for their approval and love. It's almost like you're holding onto a sense of security and belonging that comes from trying to meet their expectations. Can you help me understand what you think would happen if you were to start to cultivate a sense of self-worth that's not dependent on their approval?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah, I can see how my fear of rejection or not being loved for who I am has been driving my need to please them all the time. I think if I could start to cultivate a sense of self-worth that's not dependent on their approval, I might feel more confident and relaxed around them, and be able to connect with them in a more authentic way.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're starting to recognize the impact that your grandparents' expectations have on your sense of self-worth, and that's a really important awareness to have. Can you help me understand what you think would happen if you were to start setting some boundaries around your own needs and desires, rather than constantly trying to meet their expectations? How do you think that would affect your relationships with them, and what do you think you might gain from taking this approach?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think it's going to take some time for me to adjust to the idea of not trying to please my grandpa all the time, but I'm willing to try. I'm scared of what might happen if I don't meet their expectations, but at the same time, I'm tired of feeling like I'm walking on eggshells around them. I want to be able to have a more authentic relationship with them, even if that means they don't always agree with me or do things the way I expect them to.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>As you start to explore what it means to prioritize your own needs and desires, I want to acknowledge that this can be a scary and uncertain process. It's natural to worry about how your grandparents will react, and whether they'll still love and accept you if you're not living up to their expectations. Can you help me understand what you think would happen if you were to start having open and honest conversations with them about your feelings and needs? How do you think that might help you feel more seen, heard, and understood, and what do you think you might gain from having these conversations?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I'm starting to realize that I've been so focused on trying to meet my grandpa's expectations that I haven't stopped to think about what I actually want and need from our relationship.

What does it mean to you to feel loved and accepted by him, and how might that be different from trying to please him?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think I'm starting to understand that my grandpa's love and acceptance aren't dependent on me being a certain way or doing certain things.
