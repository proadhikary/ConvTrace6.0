                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Hello Carlos, I'm glad you could make it today. What brings you here to see me?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I've been really struggling with cooking. I feel like I should be good at it because my dad was a cook, but I just can't seem to get it right.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It makes sense that you'd feel the need to justify your cooking skills to your wife, especially since your dad was a professional cook. Can you help me understand what you're hoping to achieve by proving yourself in the kitchen? Is it a way to prove to yourself or to others that you're capable, or is there something else at play here?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I guess it's a mix of both. I want to prove to myself that I can do it, but I also feel like I'm letting my wife down if I don't cook well. It's like I'm carrying this expectation from my dad to live up to, and it's hard for me to shake off.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like the pressure to live up to your father's legacy is not only affecting your cooking but also your sense of identity and self-worth. Can you help me better understand what you think your father would say to you if he were here right now, and how that might influence your feelings about cooking and your ability to let go of those expectations?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think my dad would probably be disappointed in me if I wasn't good at cooking. He would want me to be able to do it well, and if I couldn't, he would see it as a reflection of my lack of skill or effort. It's like I'm still trying to prove myself to him, even though he's not here anymore.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It's remarkable how deeply ingrained these expectations can be, even after all this time. Carrying around the weight of someone else's dreams and aspirations can be an enormous burden. I'd like to explore this idea further - can you think of any small, incremental steps you could take to start disconnecting from these expectations and reconnecting with your own desires and passions, perhaps even in the context of cooking?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah, I've been thinking about that a lot lately. Maybe I could start by just experimenting with new recipes and ingredients without worrying about how they turn out. Or, I could try cooking with friends instead of just for my wife. I've always enjoyed cooking with my friends when we're out at a restaurant or whatever, so maybe that would take some of the pressure off.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It's fascinating to see how your thoughts about cooking have evolved, and I'm curious to explore this idea of prioritizing your own enjoyment in the kitchen. How do you think this shift in perspective might influence your relationship with your wife, and what are your hopes for how she might respond to this change?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think it would be really great for our relationship if I could find a way to enjoy cooking again. Maybe my wife would even be more supportive of me, and we could spend more time together in the kitchen. It's been tough on our relationship, and I feel like it's been a source of stress between us.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>I can see how this realization about your cooking habits is already starting to shift your perspective on cooking and your relationship with your wife. It's as if you're beginning to untangle the knot of expectations and obligations that's been holding you back. What do you think would be the most enjoyable part of cooking again, if you could let go of all the pressure and just focus on the process?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think the most enjoyable part would be the experimentation and creativity involved in cooking. I've always liked trying new recipes and ingredients, and when I'm not worrying about how it turns out, I can really get into it. It's almost like a form of self-expression, and it would be nice to recapture that sense of freedom and joy in the kitchen.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>As you continue to explore this new relationship with cooking, I'm curious to know, what are some small steps you can take in the next week to start integrating this sense of passion and creativity back into your daily life, and how might that impact your interactions with your wife?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think that's a great starting point, experimenting with new recipes and cooking with friends. I can see how that would take some of the pressure off and allow me to enjoy the process more. I'll definitely try to do that in the next week and see how it goes.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It's interesting that you bring up the idea of sharing this shift in perspective with your wife. I think it's possible that she might be more receptive to this new approach to cooking than you realize, and that it could even bring you closer together. However, I'm also curious - what if she doesn't respond as positively as you hope? How would you handle that, and what would that mean for your relationship moving forward?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think it's possible that my wife might not understand or appreciate this change in me, and that could be tough to navigate. But I also think that it's important for me to be true to myself and find joy in cooking again, even if that means it means she doesn't always agree with my approach. Maybe we could have an open and honest conversation about how I'm feeling and what I'm trying to achieve, and that could help us grow closer as a couple.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're recognizing the importance of prioritizing your own desires and passions in the kitchen, and that's a significant shift. By acknowledging the pressure to meet your wife's expectations and taking steps to prioritize your own enjoyment, you may find that you're not only reducing stress and pressure but also building a more positive sense of self. How do you think this shift might impact your relationship with your wife, and what are your hopes for how she might respond to this change?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think it's interesting that you bring up the idea of sharing this shift in perspective with my wife. I've been thinking about how I can communicate my newfound feelings about cooking to her in a way that she'll understand and appreciate. I'm not sure if she'll immediately be on board with my new approach, but I'm hoping that by being open and honest with her, we can have a better understanding of each other's perspectives.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>As you continue to explore this new relationship with cooking, it's essential to acknowledge that it's okay to make mistakes and that it's a process of discovery, rather than a perfect outcome. What are some specific steps you think you could take to start sharing this newfound enthusiasm with your wife, and how do you anticipate she might respond?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think it's really important for me to be honest with my wife about how I'm feeling and what I'm trying to achieve. I want to approach her in a non-judgmental way and explain that I'm not trying to prove anything to her or to myself, but rather that I want to find joy and creativity in cooking again.</div>

By acknowledging the pressure to meet your wife's expectations and taking steps to prioritize your own enjoyment, you may find that you're not only reducing stress and pressure but also building a more positive sense of self. How do you think your wife might respond if you were to approach her with this newfound enthusiasm and openness, and what are some potential benefits you hope to gain from sharing this change with her, and what concrete steps do you think you can take to initiate this conversation?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think it's essential to approach this conversation with my wife in a non-judgmental way and explain that I'm not trying to prove anything to her or to myself, but rather that I want to find joy and creativity in cooking again. I want to emphasize that I'm not asking her to change her expectations or standards, but rather that I want to explore my own passion for cooking and find a way to make it enjoyable for both of us.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It's interesting to note that by prioritizing your own desires and passions in the kitchen, you may be experiencing a sense of freedom and autonomy that you haven't felt in a while. Can you help me understand what you think this newfound freedom might mean for your overall sense of purpose and direction in life, and how you plan to continue nurturing and exploring this newfound enthusiasm?</div>

                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>As you continue to explore this newfound enthusiasm for cooking, I want to acknowledge that it's not uncommon for people to feel a sense of excitement and passion when they're able to express themselves creatively, whether that's through cooking, art, or another activity. By allowing yourself to prioritize your own desires and passions in the kitchen, you're actually modeling a healthy way of approaching relationships and personal growth. How do you think this newfound creativity and autonomy might translate to other areas of your life, and what steps can you take to start integrating this sense of passion and purpose into other aspects of your daily routine?</div>

                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>As you've started to prioritize your own desires and passions in cooking, I'm wondering if you've noticed any changes in your relationship with your wife. Are there any moments where you feel more connected to her, or where you're able to share your love for cooking in a way that feels more authentic and enjoyable for both of you?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think I have been trying to live up to my father's expectations, and it's hard to shake off the feeling that I'm not good enough.
