                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Hi Blake, welcome to our session. It's great to have you here. Can you tell me what has brought you in today?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I've been feeling pretty down about my cooking skills lately. It all started a few months ago when I burnt some spaghetti sauce, and since then, I can't seem to shake the feeling that I'm just not good at cooking.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It's interesting that you mention feeling like you're not living up to your own expectations, and that this fear of not being good enough is really impacting your confidence. Can you help me understand what you think would happen if you were to accept that you're not perfect and that it's okay to make mistakes? How do you think that would change your relationship with cooking and maybe even with yourself?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>That's a great question, and I think if I were to accept that I'm not perfect and that it's okay to make mistakes, I would feel a lot less pressure to be perfect. I think I would start to enjoy cooking more, and I wouldn't be so hard on myself when I make mistakes. I would also be more willing to try new recipes and take risks, because I wouldn't be so afraid of failure.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>I love how you're recognizing that perfectionism is holding you back from truly enjoying cooking. It's interesting to explore how this pressure to be perfect might be tied to your self-image or even past experiences with cooking. Can you tell me more about what comes up for you when you think about making mistakes or not being perfect in the kitchen?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah, I think it's because I've always been someone who strives for perfection, and I've always been told that I'm good at things, so when I make a mistake, it's like I'm not living up to my own expectations. It's like I'm not good enough, and that's a hard pill to swallow.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It's interesting to see how this dynamic is playing out in your life, especially in the kitchen, where you're trying to create something nourishing and delicious for yourself and others. It's as if you're carrying around this idea that you should be perfect, and when you're not, it's like you're failing not just as a cook, but also as a person. Many people struggle with this pressure to be perfect, and it can be really exhausting. Can you tell me more about what you think would happen if you were to let go of this need for perfection and just focus on enjoying the process of cooking?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>That's a great point, and I think if I were to let go of this need for perfection, I would be able to enjoy cooking more and not put so much pressure on myself. I think I would also be able to view mistakes as opportunities to learn and grow, rather than failures. It's helped me to see that I don't have to be perfect all the time, and that it's okay to make mistakes.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It's interesting to me that you're recognizing the impact of perfectionism on your cooking experiences. It's almost as if you're trying to control the outcome of your cooking, rather than enjoying the process of creating something nourishing for yourself and others. Can you help me understand what you think would happen if you were to let go of that need for control and just focus on the experience of cooking, rather than the outcome?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think if I were to let go of that need for control, I would be able to relax more in the kitchen and not feel so anxious about making mistakes. I would also be able to enjoy the process of cooking more, and not just focus on the end result. Maybe I would even start to see cooking as a form of self-care, rather than a way to impress others or meet certain standards.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>As you're recognizing this need for control and perfectionism in the kitchen, it's understandable that it's been causing you a lot of stress and anxiety. It's almost as if you're trying to prove something to yourself or others through your cooking, which can be exhausting. Can you help me understand what you think would happen if you were to take a step back and reframe your approach to cooking, focusing more on the process and less on the outcome?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think reframing my approach to cooking would allow me to focus more on the experience and less on the outcome. It would help me to enjoy the process of cooking, rather than just trying to create the perfect dish. I would be more relaxed and less anxious, and I would be able to view mistakes as opportunities to learn and grow, rather than failures. Additionally, I think reframing my approach would help me to see cooking as a form of self-care, rather than a way to impress others or meet certain standards.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>As you're recognizing the pressure you're putting on yourself to be perfect in the kitchen, I want to normalize that feeling for you - it's common to feel that way when we're deeply invested in something. Can you help me understand what you think would happen if you were to acknowledge that it's okay to make mistakes and that they're an inevitable part of the learning process? How might that change your experience of cooking and your relationship with yourself?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think acknowledging that it's okay to make mistakes would be a huge relief for me. It would allow me to relax more in the kitchen and not feel so anxious about making mistakes. I would be more willing to take risks and try new things, knowing that it's okay if they don't turn out perfectly. And I think it would also help me to view mistakes as opportunities to learn and grow, rather than failures. It's funny, I never thought about it before, but I think I've been using cooking as a way to prove something to myself, like I'm capable of being a good cook, and if I make a mistake, I feel like I'm failing. But if I can acknowledge that it's okay to make mistakes, I think I'll be able to enjoy the process of cooking more and not put so much pressure on myself.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're starting to see that your perfectionism in the kitchen is not only affecting your enjoyment of cooking, but also your overall well-being. It's amazing how our struggles in one area of life can have a ripple effect on other areas.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I'm starting to realize that my perfectionism in the kitchen is not just about cooking, but also about how I view myself and my abilities. I think I've been using cooking as a way to prove my worth, and when I make a mistake, I feel like I'm not good enough. But if I can acknowledge that it's okay to make mistakes and that they're an inevitable part of the learning process, I think I'll be able to relax more in the kitchen and enjoy the process of cooking, rather than just trying to create the perfect dish.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It's interesting to see how this pattern of needing to prove yourself is playing out in your cooking, and how it's connected to your sense of self-worth. Can you help me understand what you think would happen if you were to shift your focus from trying to prove yourself to simply taking pleasure in the process of cooking, and allowing yourself to be present in the moment?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think that would be a huge shift for me. If I were to focus on taking pleasure in the process of cooking, I would be able to let go of the need to prove myself and just enjoy the experience. I would be more present in the moment, and I would be able to appreciate the little things, like the smell of the food, the taste of the ingredients, and the feeling of accomplishment when I create something delicious. It's funny, I never thought about it before, but I think I've been so focused on trying to create the perfect dish that I've been missing out on the joy of cooking.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>As you're recognizing the joy in cooking, I want to acknowledge that it's not uncommon for people to get caught up in perfectionism, especially when it comes to creative pursuits. It's as if we're trying to prove our worth to ourselves and others through our work. Can you help me understand what you think would happen if you were to let go of that need for perfection and instead focus on nourishing yourself and others through cooking? How might that change your experience of cooking and your relationship with yourself?</div>

                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're already taking a big step towards recognizing the pressure you're putting on yourself to be perfect, and that's a huge accomplishment. I want to build on that by asking, what do you think would happen if you were to not only let go of the need for perfection, but also the need to control the outcome of your cooking? Would you be more willing to take risks, try new things, and learn from your mistakes?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think if I were to not only let go of the need for perfection, but also the need to control the outcome of my cooking, I would be more willing to take risks and try new things. I would be more open to learning from my mistakes and view them as opportunities to grow and improve. I think that would allow me to relax more in the kitchen and enjoy the process of cooking, rather than just trying to create the perfect dish.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>As you're recognizing the impact of your perfectionism and need for control on your cooking experiences, I want to acknowledge that it takes a lot of courage to confront these patterns and consider alternative approaches. Can you help me understand what you think would happen if you were to lean into this newfound awareness and intentionally cultivate a sense of curiosity and experimentation in the kitchen, rather than striving for perfection? How might that change your relationship with cooking and yourself?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think if I were to lean into this newfound awareness and intentionally cultivate a sense of curiosity and experimentation in the kitchen, I would be more open to trying new recipes and ingredients, and I wouldn't be so afraid of making mistakes.

                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>As you've been exploring this connection between your perfectionism and cooking, I've noticed that you've been carrying a lot of self-criticism and judgment around your abilities. It's almost as if you're trying to prove to yourself that you're a good cook, rather than just enjoying the process. Can you help me understand what it would take for you to let go of that self-criticism and instead focus on the pleasure and satisfaction that comes from cooking?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>It's been really helpful to explore this connection between my perfectionism and cooking. I think what's been holding me back is the fear of not being good enough, and that's led me to put so much pressure on myself to create the perfect dish. But as we've been talking, I'm starting to see that it's not just about the cooking, it's about how I view myself and my abilities. I think I've been using cooking as a way to prove my worth, and when I make a mistake, I feel like I'm not good enough. But if I can acknowledge that it's okay to make mistakes and that they're an inevitable part of the learning process, I think I'll be able to relax more in the kitchen and enjoy the process of cooking, rather than just trying to create the perfect dish.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It's fascinating to see how your perfectionism has been linked to cooking, and I think it's remarkable that you're recognizing the impact it has on your self-image. Can you help me understand what you think would happen if you were to separate your self-worth from your cooking abilities, and instead focus on the joy and satisfaction that comes from creating something nourishing for yourself and others? How might that change your relationship with cooking and yourself?</div>

                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>As you explore the connection between your perfectionism and self-criticism, I'd like to offer that it's common for individuals to struggle with this dynamic, especially when it comes to creative pursuits like cooking. In fact, research suggests that perfectionism can often be driven by a desire for self-protection, rather than a genuine passion for the activity itself. Would you be willing to examine what you think might be driving your need for perfection in the kitchen, and what you think would happen if you were to let go of that need and focus on the process of cooking, rather than the outcome?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think that's a great point, and it's interesting that you bring up the idea that perfectionism can be driven by a desire for self-protection.

                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like this pressure to be perfect in the kitchen has been a recurring theme in your life, and it's not limited to cooking.

                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think that my perfectionism is affecting other areas of my life as well, not just cooking. For instance, I've noticed that I put a lot of pressure on myself to be perfect in my relationships, whether it's with friends, family, or romantic partners. I feel like I need to be a certain way, or do certain things, in order to be liked and accepted. And when I don't meet those expectations, I feel like I've failed, and that's really hard for me to deal with. I think if I were to adopt a more compassionate and accepting approach towards myself, I would be able to relax more and not feel so much pressure to be perfect.

Can you tell me more about what you think it would mean to adopt a more compassionate and accepting approach towards yourself, and how that might change your relationships and overall sense of well-being?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think adopting a more compassionate and accepting approach towards myself would mean letting go of the need to be perfect and accepting that I'm human and make mistakes. It would mean being kind to myself when I make a mistake, rather than beating myself up over it. It would mean understanding that it's okay not to be perfect and that it's okay to ask for help or make compromises. It would mean being more present in the moment and enjoying the experience, rather than trying to control the outcome.</div>

Can you tell me more about what you think would happen if you were to adopt this approach, and how you might apply it to your daily life?</div>
