                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Hello, Brian. It's nice to meet you. How are you feeling today?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I feel like my anxiety is mostly tied to my students' performance. When they don't do well, I can't help but think it's because I'm failing as a teacher.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It's understandable that you'd be feeling overwhelmed by these thoughts, especially when you're already deeply invested in your students' success. Can you tell me more about what you think would happen if you were able to let go of some of that self-criticism and focus more on what you're doing well as a teacher?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I'm not sure, to be honest. I mean, I've tried to focus on the positive aspects of my teaching, but it's hard to shake off the feeling that I'm not good enough. And even when I do manage to focus on something I did well, it's like a fleeting moment of relief before the self-doubt creeps back in.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're caught in a cycle where your self-criticism is constantly pulling you back down, making it tough to build momentum and confidence in your teaching. Can you help me understand what you think would happen if you were able to break free from that cycle and focus on your strengths for a bit longer? How do you think that might impact your overall sense of competence and confidence in the classroom?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think if I could break free from that cycle, I might be able to focus more on my students' actual learning and growth, rather than my own perceived failures. Maybe I could even start to see myself as a teacher who is making a positive impact, rather than just a teacher who is constantly struggling to keep his students from failing. But it's scary to think about letting go of that self-criticism, because it's become such a familiar and comforting part of my teaching identity.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It's interesting that you mention the fear of losing your sense of self, and I think it's important to recognize that this fear is not unique to you. Many people struggle with the idea of letting go of aspects of themselves that have become so deeply ingrained, even if those aspects are causing distress. Can you help me understand what you think would happen to your sense of identity if you were to shift your focus away from self-criticism and towards your strengths and accomplishments as a teacher?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>That's a good point, I think I've become so used to beating myself up over my perceived failures that it's hard to imagine who I would be without that constant self-criticism. Maybe I would feel more authentic and genuine as a teacher, rather than just trying to prove myself to my students and colleagues. But at the same time, it's scary to think about losing that sense of purpose that comes from striving for perfection.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>As you've shared, it's clear that this self-criticism has become a deeply ingrained pattern, and it's understandable that it's hard to imagine who you would be without it. Can you help me understand what you think would happen to your relationships with your students and colleagues if you were to start focusing more on your strengths and accomplishments as a teacher? How do you think they would respond to you, and what do you think would change in those relationships?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think if I were to shift my focus away from self-criticism and towards my strengths and accomplishments, my students and colleagues might start to see me in a different light. They might notice that I'm more confident and more enthusiastic about teaching, and that could lead to more positive interactions and stronger relationships. But at the same time, it's scary to think about changing how others perceive me, because I'm not sure if they would still respect me as a teacher if I'm not constantly striving for perfection.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It's interesting that you're considering the potential impact on your relationships with your students and colleagues if you were to focus more on your strengths and accomplishments as a teacher. Can you tell me more about what you think would happen to your authority and expertise in the classroom if you were to shift your focus away from self-criticism and towards your strengths? How do you think your students would respond to a more confident and self-assured teacher, and what do you think would happen to your relationships with your colleagues?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think it's possible that my students would start to see me as a more credible and knowledgeable teacher if I were to focus on my strengths and accomplishments. They might notice that I'm more confident and more enthusiastic about teaching, and that could lead to more positive interactions and stronger relationships.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>As you're recognizing the impact that self-criticism could have on your relationships with your students and colleagues, it's also important to acknowledge that this isn't just about being liked or respected, but also about being a more effective teacher. When you're focusing on your strengths and accomplishments, you're more likely to be in a state of flow and engagement, which can lead to more creative and innovative teaching approaches. This can ultimately benefit your students the most, as they're receiving a more focused and effective instruction.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I suppose it's possible that if I were to shift my focus away from self-criticism and towards my strengths and accomplishments, I might become a more effective teacher, and my students would benefit from that. But it's hard for me to imagine letting go of that constant drive for perfection, because it's become such a big part of who I am as a teacher.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>As you've been reflecting on the potential impact of focusing on your strengths and accomplishments, I want to acknowledge that it's understandable that this feels like a significant shift from your current approach. It's true that perfectionism can be a powerful driving force, and it's not surprising that it's become deeply ingrained in your teaching identity.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I'm starting to realize that my constant self-criticism is not only affecting my teaching, but also my relationships with my students and colleagues. I think if I were to shift my focus away from perfectionism and towards my strengths and accomplishments, I might become a more effective teacher, and my students would benefit from that. However, it's hard for me to imagine letting go of that constant drive for perfection, because it's become such a big part of who I am as a teacher.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're starting to see the potential benefits of shifting your focus away from perfectionism and towards your strengths and accomplishments as a teacher, and that's a really important step in making progress. Can you help me understand what you think would happen to your sense of identity and purpose as a teacher if you were to start focusing more on what you're doing well, rather than what you're doing poorly?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think that if I were to focus more on what I'm doing well, I might start to see myself as a teacher who is making a positive impact, rather than just a teacher who is constantly struggling to keep his students from failing.

                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>As you start to imagine what it would be like to focus on your strengths and accomplishments, I notice that you're highlighting the potential benefits for your students and colleagues. Can you help me understand what you think would happen to your own sense of well-being and motivation if you were to start focusing more on what you're doing well, rather than what you're doing poorly? How do you think that might impact your overall job satisfaction and enthusiasm for teaching?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think if I were to focus more on what I'm doing well, I might start to feel a sense of relief and reduction in anxiety, as I wouldn't be constantly beating myself up over perceived failures. I might also start to feel more energized and motivated, as I would be focusing on positive aspects of my teaching rather than dwelling on the negative. Additionally, I think I would feel more confident and self-assured, which could lead to a more positive and enthusiastic attitude towards teaching.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're already starting to imagine the positive impact that focusing on your strengths and accomplishments could have on your relationships with your students and colleagues, as well as your own sense of well-being and motivation. Research has shown that when teachers focus on their strengths and accomplishments, they often experience increased job satisfaction, reduced burnout, and improved relationships with their students and colleagues. What are some specific strengths and accomplishments that you're particularly proud of in your teaching practice, and how do you think highlighting those could positively impact your classroom dynamics and student outcomes?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think if I were to focus more on my strengths and accomplishments, I would be more likely to recognize the positive impact I have on my students' learning and growth. For instance, I've had students come back to visit me after graduating and share how much they appreciated my teaching style and how it helped them develop critical thinking skills. Highlighting those strengths and accomplishments could help me build stronger relationships with my students, and they might start to see me as a more authentic and confident teacher.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It's great to acknowledge that it's natural to feel a sense of excitement and nervousness when considering a shift away from perfectionism and towards your strengths and accomplishments. Can you help me understand what specific steps you think you would need to take in order to start focusing more on your strengths and accomplishments as a teacher, and what kind of support system you might need to help you stay on track with this new approach? Additionally, are there any specific resources or tools that you've used in the past that have helped you feel more confident and empowered in your teaching practice?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think I've been so focused on my students' performance that I haven't really taken the time to reflect on my own strengths and accomplishments as a teacher. Maybe if I started keeping a journal or log of all the positive feedback I've received from students and colleagues, it would help me shift my focus away from self-criticism and towards what I'm doing well. Additionally, I've found that receiving feedback from colleagues or mentors has been helpful in the past, so maybe scheduling regular check-ins with them could also help me stay accountable and focused on my strengths.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>By acknowledging and building on your strengths and accomplishments, you can start to shift the focus away from self-criticism and towards a more empowering sense of confidence and competence.

                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It's fascinating to see how acknowledging your strengths and accomplishments as a teacher is not only impacting your self-perception but also your approach to teaching. By recognizing the positive impact you're already having on your students, you're setting a powerful example for them about the importance of self-awareness and growth. Can you tell me more about what you think this might mean for their personal and academic development?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think that by focusing on my strengths and accomplishments as a teacher, I can create a more positive and empowering environment for my students. When students see their teacher being confident and self-assured, it can inspire them to be more confident and self-assured as well. Additionally, highlighting my strengths and accomplishments can help me build stronger relationships with my students, as they will be more likely to trust and respect me as a teacher.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It's interesting to acknowledge that perfectionism can sometimes mask a deep desire to be of service to others, and it's clear that your motivation to teach comes from a genuine sense of passion and commitment. By recognizing this, can we start to explore ways in which you can channel this energy into more positive and sustainable ways of interacting with your students and colleagues?</div>

I'd like to build on that by exploring some strategies that might help you cultivate a more positive and empowering classroom environment. Research has shown that when teachers focus on building relationships and acknowledging student strengths, it can lead to improved student outcomes and increased student engagement. What do you think about trying to incorporate more positive feedback and acknowledgment into your daily interactions with students?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think that's a great idea. I've been so focused on correcting their mistakes that I've forgotten the importance of acknowledging their strengths and accomplishments.
