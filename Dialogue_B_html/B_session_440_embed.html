                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Hi Brian, thank you for coming in today. How are you feeling right now?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>It's just frustrating. I mean, I've always enjoyed fishing, but after that last trip, I can't shake off this feeling of being completely useless at it.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like the experience has really shaken your confidence in your abilities, both in fishing and potentially in other areas of your life. Can you help me understand what you think might be the root cause of this feeling of being useless, and how you've been trying to cope with it since the trip?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I don't know, it just feels like I'm not good enough, you know? Like, I've always been a decent fisherman, but now it's like my skills have just disappeared. And it's not just the fishing, it's like I'm a failure in general. I've been trying to distract myself by focusing on my work as a paramedic, but even that feels like it's going downhill.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It's not uncommon for a single experience, even one that's meaningful like a fishing trip, to have a ripple effect on our sense of self-worth and confidence. It sounds like you're carrying around a heavy burden of self-doubt, and it's affecting not just your fishing but also your work as a paramedic. Can you help me understand what you think you could do differently in the future to shake off these feelings of inadequacy and get back to feeling confident in your abilities?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I don't know, it's like... I feel like I'm stuck in this rut and I don't know how to get out of it. Every time I think about fishing, I just feel like a complete failure. And it's not just fishing, it's like I'm a failure in general. I've been trying to distract myself by focusing on my work as a paramedic, but even that feels like it's going downhill.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're carrying a significant weight of self-doubt and failure, not just related to fishing but also affecting other areas of your life, including your work as a paramedic. Can you help me understand what you think might be the underlying message or expectation that's driving this sense of failure, and how you can start to challenge those expectations and reframe your self-talk?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I don't understand why I'm still carrying around this feeling of failure and incompetence. It's like, I know I'm a good paramedic, but this one experience with fishing just totally wiped out all my confidence. I feel like I'm stuck in this never-ending cycle of self-doubt and I don't know how to break free from it.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It's interesting that you mention feeling like this experience has erased all your confidence, because often our identities are complex and multi-faceted, and one event alone can't completely define who we are. Can you help me explore some of the ways in which you've been trying to make sense of this experience and how it's impacting your daily life as a paramedic?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I don't know, it just seems like no matter what I do, I'll always be a failure at something. And it's not just this one experience, it's like I'm carrying around this feeling of inadequacy with me all the time. I feel like I'm just waiting for the other shoe to drop, like something else is going to go wrong and I'll be proven incompetent once and for all.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It's interesting that you mention feeling like you're one step ahead of a disaster, always anticipating the worst case scenario. This kind of hypervigilance can be really draining and it's not surprising you're feeling overwhelmed. Can you help me understand what you think would happen if you were to let go of that fear of failure and just focus on the present moment? How would that affect your confidence and overall well-being?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>It's hard for me to imagine that because I've been carrying around this feeling of inadequacy for so long, it feels like it's a part of who I am. I don't know if I can just let go of it and expect everything to be okay.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It's not uncommon for people to feel like their struggles with self-doubt and inadequacy are deeply ingrained and hard to shake off, and it's great that you're acknowledging the complexity of your feelings. Can you tell me more about what you think would happen if you were to start to work on building up your confidence and self-worth, even if it feels like a small step? How do you think that might impact your relationships with your patients and colleagues, and what kind of benefits do you think you might experience as a result?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I don't know, it just feels like I'm stuck in this never-ending cycle of self-doubt and I don't know how to break free from it.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It's understandable that you're feeling this way, especially given the high-stakes nature of your work as a paramedic. Can you help me understand what you think would happen if you were able to break free from this cycle of self-doubt and focus on the present moment, without the weight of fear of failure holding you back?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I know it sounds silly, but I just can't help but feel like I'm a failure at everything. Even my job as a paramedic, which I normally love, feels like it's not going well. I'm starting to wonder if I'm just not cut out for this kind of work.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It's not uncommon for even the most skilled and capable professionals like yourself to experience a sense of failure and self-doubt, especially when it comes to high-stress jobs like being a paramedic. Can you help me understand what you think is driving this sense of self-doubt and failure, and how you think it might be related to your experiences as a paramedic?</div>

Can you help me understand what you think would happen if you were to separate your sense of self-worth as a person from your performance as a paramedic? How might you be able to acknowledge and learn from this experience without letting it define your entire sense of identity?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I don't know how to break free from this cycle of self-doubt. It feels like it's consumed me and I'm not sure how to shake it off.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like this cycle of self-doubt is not only affecting your confidence but also your sense of purpose and identity as a paramedic. Can you help me understand what you think would happen if you were to approach your work with a sense of curiosity and experimentation, rather than perfectionism and self-criticism? How might you be able to reframe your experiences and focus on the things that go well, rather than getting caught up in the things that don't go according to plan?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I'm starting to feel like I'm never going to be able to break free from this cycle of self-doubt and failure. It's like it's just who I am now, and I don't know how to change that.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like this cycle of self-doubt and failure has been going on for a while, and it's not only affecting your confidence but also your sense of purpose and identity as a paramedic.

                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It's interesting that you bring up the idea of needing to be perfect as a paramedic. Can you tell me more about what that means to you and how that pressure to be perfect is impacting your daily work? Additionally, I want to acknowledge that it's not uncommon for individuals in high-stress professions like yours to struggle with self-doubt and perfectionism.</div>
