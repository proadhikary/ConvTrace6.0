                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Hi Gina, it's nice to meet you. How are you feeling today?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I'm feeling pretty down about myself lately. The incident during the rehearsals has really shaken my confidence, and I can't seem to get past it.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like the incident has really stirred up some painful emotions and doubts about your abilities as a dancer, and it's no wonder you're struggling to shake them off. Can you help me understand what specifically about that moment during rehearsals has been replaying in your mind and why it's got you wondering if you're still good enough as a dancer?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>It's just that I feel like I've let everyone down, including myself. I was supposed to be this perfect dancer, and then I got knocked down by someone else. It's like, what's wrong with me? Why can't I even do my job without messing up?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like this incident has really shaken your foundation as a dancer and as a person, and it's understandable that you're struggling to come to terms with it. Can you help me understand what you think you need to do to move forward from this place of self-doubt and guilt, and what small steps you might be willing to take to start rebuilding your confidence as a dancer?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I don't know... I just feel like I'm stuck in this rut and I don't know how to get out of it. Every time I think about what happened, I feel like I'm going to break down and cry.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like the experience has left you feeling like you're struggling to reconcile your sense of identity as a dancer with the failure, and it's making it hard for you to see a way forward. Can you help me understand what you think would be the most helpful step for you to take in order to start moving towards a sense of resolution and closure?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>It's just that I feel like I'm stuck in this cycle of self-blame and shame, and no matter how hard I try, I can't seem to shake it off. I feel like I'm just going through the motions of rehearsals and performances, but I'm not really present because I'm so caught up in my own negative thoughts. I don't know how to stop feeling like this.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>I can see how this pattern of negative self-talk and self-blame has become a familiar and automatic response for you, and it's no wonder you're feeling stuck. Shame and self-blame can be incredibly pervasive and hard to shake off, but it's important to remember that they're not necessarily an accurate reflection of our worth or value as people. Would you be willing to explore with me what you think is driving this cycle of self-blame, and how it's impacting your daily life and relationships?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I'm not sure... it just feels like this incident has taken over my life and I'm just going through the motions, feeling like I'm stuck in this cycle of self-blame and shame. I don't know how to break free from it.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're carrying the weight of this incident on your shoulders, and it's no wonder you're struggling to find peace and freedom from the negative thoughts that plague you. Shame and self-blame can be particularly powerful and entrenched patterns, and it's not uncommon for them to feel like a deeply ingrained part of our identity. Can you help me understand how you think this self-protective mechanism has developed in your case, and what role you think it's playing in your current struggles with self-doubt and guilt?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah, I guess I just feel like I've lost myself in all of this. I used to love dancing, and now it feels like it's all I'm good for. I'm just stuck in this cycle of self-doubt and guilt, and I don't know how to get out of it.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like this incident has become a kind of emotional weight that's been crushing your sense of identity and purpose as a dancer, making it hard for you to imagine a future where you can love dancing again. Can you help me understand what you think would need to shift in order for you to feel like you can start moving forward and rekindling that passion for dancing that was once so important to you?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I'm trying to understand why I'm still stuck in this cycle of self-blame and shame. It feels like I'm beating myself up over something that was an accident, and I just can't seem to let it go. I feel like I'm constantly replaying the incident in my head, wondering what I could have done differently, and it's like I'm trapped in this never-ending loop of what ifs and should haves.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It's no wonder that this pattern of self-blame and rumination has become so entrenched, considering the trauma and emotional distress you've experienced. It's like your mind is trying to make sense of the chaos by replaying the event over and over, hoping to find some kind of answers or closure.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>It's like I'm constantly trying to prove myself to others, even to myself, that I'm still a good dancer, that I haven't lost my touch. But the more I try to prove it, the more I feel like I'm failing. It's this constant cycle of self-doubt and fear of failure that's holding me back from truly enjoying my passion for dancing again.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It's as if you're carrying the weight of your past successes and failures on your shoulders, and it's making it hard for you to move forward and enjoy dancing again. Let me ask, what do you think would happen if you were to reframe your thinking around failure, and instead of seeing it as a reflection of your worth, you saw it as an opportunity to learn and grow as a dancer?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think that's a really hard thing to do, to reframe my thinking around failure. It's like, my whole identity as a dancer is tied up in being perfect, and the thought of failing is just too scary for me. But I can see how it's holding me back from truly enjoying dancing again.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It's understandable that the pressure to perform flawlessly in ballet has led to a strong emphasis on perfection in your life, and it's not uncommon for dancers to feel like their self-worth is closely tied to their performance.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>It's like I'm trapped in this never-ending loop of self-blame and shame, constantly replaying the incident in my head, wondering what I could have done differently. I feel like I'm stuck in this vicious cycle, and I don't know how to break free from it.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>As you reflect on your experience, it's clear that the weight of this incident has had a profound impact on your life, including your relationship with dancing. It's not uncommon for people to get stuck in cycles of self-blame and shame, especially when they feel like they've let themselves or others down. Research has shown that rumination on negative experiences can actually strengthen the neural pathways associated with self-criticism, making it even harder to break free from these patterns. How do you think you could start to challenge these negative thoughts and work towards a more compassionate and understanding relationship with yourself?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I guess I feel like I've been so focused on what happened and how I should have prevented it that I haven't really taken the time to acknowledge my own resilience and strengths as a dancer. It's like, I've been so caught up in beating myself up over this one mistake that I've forgotten all the times I've successfully performed and received praise from others. I think that's what I need to focus on - reminding myself that I'm more than just one mistake.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're recognizing the importance of acknowledging your own strengths and resilience as a dancer, and that's a crucial step in breaking free from the cycle of self-blame and shame. Can you help me understand what it would mean for you to start treating yourself with the same kindness and understanding that you would offer to a friend in a similar situation, and how that might start to shift your relationship with failure and imperfection?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think that's a really good point. I've been so focused on what happened and how I should have prevented it that I haven't really taken the time to acknowledge my own resilience and strengths as a dancer. It's like, I've been so caught up in beating myself up over this one mistake that I haven't forgotten all the times I've successfully performed and received praise from others.

                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like acknowledging your resilience and strengths as a dancer is a crucial step in shifting your perspective and moving forward from this difficult experience. Research has shown that self-compassion can be a powerful tool in reducing self-criticism and increasing self-acceptance. Can you help me understand what it would mean for you to practice self-compassion in this situation, and how that might help you to reframe your experience and move forward?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think I've been so focused on the negative aspects of this incident that I haven't really taken the time to process my emotions and work through my feelings. It's like, I've been so caught up in beating myself up over this one mistake that I haven't really allowed myself to feel the pain and sadness that I'm experiencing. I think that's what I need to focus on - allowing myself to feel my emotions and work through them in a healthy way.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>As you reflect on the importance of acknowledging your strengths and resilience as a dancer, I want to remind you that it's common for people to struggle with self-blame and shame after a setback. Research has shown that our brains are wired to focus on negative experiences, and it's only natural that you'd be carrying around some emotional weight from this incident. But it's also important to recognize that you're not alone in this struggle, and that there are ways to work through these emotions and develop a more compassionate relationship with yourself. Can you help me understand what small steps you might be willing to take to start practicing self-compassion, and how that might help you to reframe your experience and move forward?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I'm just so frustrated with myself. I feel like I've been stuck in this rut for so long, and I don't know how to get out of it. I've tried to focus on my strengths and accomplishments as a dancer, but it's hard to shake off the feeling that I'm not good enough. I just feel like I'm constantly replaying the incident in my head, wondering what I could have done differently, and it's like I'm trapped in this never-ending loop of self-blame and shame.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're still carrying around a lot of emotional weight from this incident, and it's no wonder you're feeling stuck and frustrated. Research has shown that our brains tend to distort and exaggerate our flaws and mistakes, making it difficult to view ourselves objectively. Can you help me understand how you think this incident has changed your perception of yourself as a dancer, and what small steps you might need to take to start rebuilding your confidence and sense of identity as a performer?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I feel like I'm stuck in this cycle of self-blame and shame, constantly replaying the incident in my head, wondering what I could have done differently. I feel like I'm trapped in this never-ending loop of what ifs and should haves.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>As I listen to you, I'm struck by how this incident has not only affected your confidence as a dancer but also your sense of identity as a person. It's as if you're struggling to reconcile the dancer you once were with the dancer you feel you've become. Can you help me understand what you think it would take for you to start seeing yourself as a dancer again, rather than just a person who's made a mistake?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I'm really struggling to see myself as a dancer again. It's like, I've lost my identity as a performer and I don't know how to get it back. I feel like I've been defined by this one mistake and it's hard to shake off the feeling that I'm not good enough. I'm just so frustrated with myself and I don't know how to get out of this rut.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It's fascinating to me that you're still replaying that incident in your head, and I think it's because your brain is trying to make sense of what happened and how it's impacted your sense of identity as a dancer. This is a common phenomenon, and it's not uncommon for people to get stuck on negative experiences. By reframing your thoughts and focusing on the present moment, rather than dwelling on the past, you might be able to start building back your confidence and sense of identity as a performer. Can you help me understand what that would look like for you, and what small steps you might be willing to take to start moving in that direction?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think I've been trying to prove myself to others, even to myself, that I'm still a good dancer, that I haven't lost my touch.

                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It's not uncommon for people to get caught up in the need to prove themselves, especially when they're passionate about something like dancing. It sounds like you're recognizing that this need is actually taking away from your enjoyment of dance, rather than adding to it.</div>

It's like your mind is replaying the tape over and over again, and it's hard to shake off the feeling that you're not good enough. Can you help me understand what you think would happen if you were to challenge those negative thoughts and replace them with more balanced and realistic ones?</div>
