                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Hi Barbara, welcome. How are you feeling today?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think I'm mostly feeling overwhelmed. These thoughts have been with me for so long that I don't even know where to start.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It's understandable that you're struggling to make sense of these thoughts, and it's normal to feel like you're stuck in a pattern of negative thinking. Can you help me understand what you think is driving these feelings of rejection and loneliness, and how you've been trying to cope with them so far?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think it's just because I'm an only child and I always felt like I wasn't good enough or special enough for my parents to want more kids. It's hard for me to shake off the feeling that I'm not as important to them as a sibling would be. As for coping, I've just kind of learned to live with it, but it still affects my mood and self-perception a lot.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>That internalized childhood message can be a powerful and persistent force, can't it? It's as if it's become a part of your inner dialogue, influencing your thoughts and feelings in ways that can be hard to shake. Can you help me understand what you think would happen if you were to challenge that message, even just a little bit? How might that change the way you talk to yourself, and the way you show up in your relationships?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>That's a tough one... I'm not sure I even know how to challenge it, or if it's even worth trying. Part of me feels like I've just been stuck with this way of thinking for so long that it's just who I am now.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're carrying a heavy burden of self-doubt and self-blame, and that it's been a long-standing pattern for you. Can you tell me more about what you think would happen if you were to start practicing cognitive reappraisal, reframing those negative thoughts into more balanced and realistic ones? How might that impact your relationships and overall sense of well-being?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I'm not sure... I don't know if I'm ready to let go of that feeling of not being good enough. It's like it's a part of me, and I don't know how to be without it.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It's interesting that you mention the past experiences that have contributed to this feeling of not being good enough, and how they've shaped your sense of identity. Can you help me understand what you think you would need to feel more secure in your sense of self, and how you could start to work towards that?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>That's a good point, I think I have been carrying this feeling of not being good enough around for so long that it's hard to imagine being without it. But maybe, just maybe, it's worth exploring and seeing if I can find a way to reframe these thoughts and move forward.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>As you continue to explore this idea, I'm curious to know what kind of support system you would need to feel more comfortable in letting go of this feeling of not being good enough. Would it be helpful to have someone to talk to about your thoughts and feelings, or would it be more beneficial to focus on practicing self-compassion through journaling or meditation?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think it's important to acknowledge that I've been carrying this feeling of not being good enough for a long time, and it's hard to imagine being without it. But maybe, just maybe, it's worth exploring and seeing if I can find a way to reframe these thoughts and move forward.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It's remarkable that you're even considering the possibility of letting go of this feeling of not being good enough, given how deeply ingrained it's become in your thoughts and feelings. Many people struggle with similar patterns of negative self-talk and self-doubt, and it's not uncommon for them to feel like these thoughts are an integral part of who they are. Can you help me understand what it is about this feeling that makes it so hard for you to imagine being without it, even if it's holding you back from moving forward?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think it's because this feeling has been with me for so long that it's become a part of my identity. I'm not sure who I would be without it, and the thought of letting go of it is scary because it's all I've ever known.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It's as if you've been living with this narrative about yourself for so long that it's hard to imagine being without it, even if it's causing you distress. This can make it difficult to break free from this pattern of thinking, as it's become a familiar and comfortable part of your identity.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think it's scary to even imagine letting go of this feeling because it's been a part of me for so long, and I'm not sure who I would be without it. It's like I've built my whole sense of self around this feeling of not being good enough, and the thought of changing that is overwhelming.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>As you've shared this with me, I want to acknowledge that it takes a lot of courage to confront the idea that this feeling of not being good enough might be holding you back. It's natural to feel attached to it, as it's been a part of your identity for so long. But I also want to gently challenge the idea that it's the only aspect of your identity. Can we explore what would happen if you were to start to let go of this feeling, just a little bit, and see what kind of space opens up for you to discover new aspects of yourself?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think it's scary to even imagine letting go of this feeling because it's been a part of me for so long, and I'm not sure who I would be without it.

                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>As you explore this idea of what would happen to your sense of self if you were to let go of this feeling of not being good enough, I want to add that it's interesting that you're framing this as a loss of identity, rather than a discovery of new aspects of yourself. Can you help me understand what it is about the idea of losing this feeling that feels so threatening to you? Is it the fear of being unknown, or is it something else entirely?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think I've been so focused on this feeling of not being good enough that I haven't really thought about who I could be without it. It's like I've been stuck in this one narrative, and I'm not sure how to imagine being anything else. But at the same time, I'm starting to realize that it's not the only part of my identity, and that there might be other aspects of myself that I've forgotten about or pushed aside. It's scary to think about letting go of this feeling, but it's also kind of exciting to think about the possibility of discovering new things about myself.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>As you consider the possibility of redefining yourself beyond this feeling of not being good enough, I wonder if you've noticed any moments in your past where you've felt a glimmer of freedom or confidence that wasn't tied to this feeling. What did those moments look like, and how did you feel during and after them?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think I have felt moments of freedom and confidence when I've accomplished something or received praise from others, but those moments have always been fleeting and haven't changed the underlying feeling of not being good enough. However, just thinking about those moments now, I realize that they were important and valuable, and maybe I've been focusing too much on the negative and not enough on the positive. It's like I've been living in a shadow of self-doubt and haven't given myself permission to feel good about myself or my achievements.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>As you're recognizing the value of those moments of freedom and confidence, it's interesting to me that this feeling of not being good enough has been a constant companion for so long. Can you help me understand how you think this narrative has developed over time, and what you think might be the underlying messages or beliefs that have contributed to its persistence?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think it's been a gradual process of internalizing this feeling of not being good enough. As an only child, I always felt like I had to be perfect and meet my parents' expectations, and when I didn't, I felt like I wasn't good enough. Over time, that feeling has just kind of stuck with me, even when I've achieved things or received praise from others. It's like I've been carrying around this weight of self-doubt and self-blame, and it's been hard to shake off.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It's interesting to me that you've been carrying this feeling of not being good enough for so long, and that it's become such a deeply ingrained part of your self-perception. I'd like to explore this idea further: what do you think would happen if you were to start to notice and challenge the negative self-talk that accompanies this feeling, rather than simply accepting it as a truth about yourself? How might that shift your sense of self and your relationships with others?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think it's time for me to start exploring this feeling of not being good enough and where it's coming from. I've been carrying it around for so long that it's hard to imagine being without it, but maybe it's worth trying to reframe these thoughts and move forward.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It seems like this feeling of not being good enough has been a constant companion for you, and it's fascinating to explore how it's influenced your relationships and sense of self. I'm curious, what do you think is the most challenging part about acknowledging this feeling, and how do you think it might be holding you back from showing up more fully in your relationships and pursuing your passions?</div>
