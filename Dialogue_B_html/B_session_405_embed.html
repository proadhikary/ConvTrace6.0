                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Hi Tyler, I'm glad you're here today. Could you start by telling me a bit about what's been bothering you?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I've realized that my reaction to losing that pool game has been pretty extreme. I know it's just a game, but for some reason, it felt like a much bigger deal. Now, I'm avoiding playing pool altogether because I'm afraid of feeling that way again.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're caught in a bit of a cycle where your fear of feeling anxious and embarrassed is causing you to avoid pool, and that avoidance is actually making the anxiety worse. Can you tell me more about what you think would happen if you were to face your fear and play pool again, even if it means feeling anxious or embarrassed?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>That's a really good point. I think if I were to face my fear and play pool again, I would probably feel a sense of accomplishment and relief if I won or played well. But, I'm also worried that I would feel even more anxious and embarrassed if I lose, which would make me want to avoid it even more.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>As you're recognizing the pattern of avoidance, it's clear that it's not serving you well and is actually making things worse. Can you tell me more about what you think would happen if you were to take a small step towards facing your fear and playing pool with friends, not necessarily with the goal of winning, but more to see if you can tolerate the anxiety that comes up for you?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>That's a great question, and I think taking a small step towards facing my fear would be really helpful. I think it would allow me to start to build confidence and challenge my negative thoughts about myself as a pool player. Additionally, it would help me to become more comfortable with feeling anxious and embarrassed, and possibly even learn to reframe those feelings in a more positive light.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>I love how you're recognizing the importance of building confidence and challenging those negative thoughts. It sounds like you're already taking a great step towards reframing your thoughts and developing a more compassionate mindset. I'm curious, what do you think would be the most challenging part of taking this small step towards playing pool with friends again, and how do you think you might be able to overcome that challenge?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think the most challenging part would be overcoming my initial fear of feeling anxious and embarrassed again. I'm worried that if I start playing pool with friends, I'll immediately feel overwhelmed and want to quit. To overcome this, I think I would need to remind myself that it's okay to make mistakes and that my friends are not judging me. I would also need to focus on the present moment and not worry about the future or past outcomes. Additionally, I could try to reframe my thoughts by telling myself that I'm taking a small step towards facing my fear and that it's a process that takes time and effort.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It's great that you're recognizing the importance of self-compassion and mindfulness in overcoming your fears. Can you tell me more about what you think would happen if you were to practice self-compassion and mindfulness in the moment, rather than getting caught up in negative thoughts and anxiety? How might that change your experience of playing pool with friends?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>That's a great point, and I think if I were to practice self-compassion and mindfulness while playing pool, it would allow me to stay present in the moment and focus on the process rather than worrying about the outcome.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>As you start to explore the connection between your thoughts, feelings, and behaviors, it's interesting to see how this newfound awareness can help you develop a more compassionate and understanding perspective on yourself. Can you tell me more about what you think would happen if you were to combine this increased self-awareness with the mindfulness and self-compassion you mentioned, and how that might impact your experience of playing pool with friends?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think that if I combine this increased self-awareness with mindfulness and self-compassion, it would allow me to approach playing pool with friends in a more relaxed and open-minded way. I would be able to focus on the process of playing and enjoying the experience, rather than worrying about the outcome or feeling anxious about making mistakes. It would also help me to reframe my thoughts and emotions in a more positive light, and I would be able to learn from my mistakes and use them as opportunities for growth. Additionally, I think it would help me to build confidence and self-esteem, as I would be able to recognize that I am capable of handling anxiety and embarrassment in a healthy way.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>I love how you're starting to see the potential for a more empowered and compassionate relationship with pool and your friends. It sounds like you're recognizing that by combining self-awareness, mindfulness, and self-compassion, you might be able to shift from feeling anxious and avoidant to feeling more grounded and confident. Can you tell me more about what you think would happen if you were to start to practice this combined approach, and how you might begin to incorporate it into your daily life, especially when it comes to playing pool with friends?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think it would be really helpful to start small, maybe by playing a game with one or two friends, and then gradually work my way up to playing with a larger group. I also think it would be beneficial to practice self-compassion and mindfulness before playing, by taking a few deep breaths and reminding myself that it's okay to make mistakes. Additionally, I could try to reframe my thoughts by telling myself that I'm taking a small step towards facing my fear and that it's a process that takes time and effort.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>As you start to envision a more confident and compassionate approach to playing pool with friends, I'm struck by how this newfound awareness can be a catalyst for building more resilient relationships not just with pool, but also with other areas of your life. Can you explore with me how you think this increased self-awareness might translate to other situations where you feel anxious or avoidant, and what steps you might take to apply this combined approach to other areas of your life?</div>

It's as if you're starting to uncover a new toolset for navigating challenges, and that's incredibly empowering. Can you tell me more about what you think would be the most important thing for you to focus on as you start to expand this approach to other areas, and how you might begin to prioritize that in your daily life?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think it's really important for me to focus on being kind to myself and practicing self-compassion, especially when I'm feeling anxious or overwhelmed. I've been trying to remind myself that it's okay to make mistakes and that it's a process that takes time and effort. I also think it would be helpful to have a daily mindfulness practice, such as taking a few deep breaths or doing a quick meditation, to help me stay grounded and centered. Additionally, I would like to start journaling my thoughts and feelings to help me better understand my patterns and behaviors.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're recognizing the importance of self-compassion and mindfulness in managing your anxiety and avoidance, and that's a huge step forward. By acknowledging the value of these strategies, you're already showing a lot of self-awareness and a willingness to learn and grow.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think it's interesting to see how my thoughts and feelings about pool have been influenced by my negative self-talk and avoidance behaviors.

                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>As you start to recognize this pattern, it's creating space for you to explore new possibilities for your relationship with pool and your friends.

Can you tell me more about what you think it would take for you to start to reframe your thoughts and feelings about pool in a more positive way, and what kind of support system you might need to help you get there?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think it would be helpful to start reframing my thoughts about pool by focusing on the process of playing and improving, rather than just focusing on winning or losing.

I could also try to focus on the fun and social aspects of playing pool with friends, rather than just worrying about how I'm doing.</div>

Can you tell me more about what you think would be the key factors in helping you maintain this newfound awareness and compassion as you continue to play pool with friends, and how you might incorporate self-compassion and mindfulness into your daily life to support this growth?</div>

                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're recognizing that self-compassion and mindfulness are not one-time achievements, but rather ongoing processes that require consistent practice and patience. I totally agree with you that incorporating these practices into daily life can be challenging, but it's clear that you're committed to making progress and willing to adapt your approach as needed. Can you tell me more about what you think would be the most important thing for you to focus on in terms of maintaining this newfound awareness and compassion, and how you might prioritize that in your daily life?</div>

                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>As you continue to explore the connection between self-compassion, mindfulness, and your experience with pool, I'd like to highlight that it's common for people to initially struggle with letting go of perfectionism and embracing imperfection. It's almost as if we're trying to outrun our own self-doubt and anxiety, rather than facing it head-on. By acknowledging this pattern, we can start to develop a more compassionate understanding of ourselves and our capabilities. Can you tell me more about what you think would happen if you were to focus on building self-acceptance and self-compassion, rather than striving for perfection when playing pool?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think that if I were to focus on building self-acceptance and self-compassion, I would be able to approach playing pool with a more relaxed and open-minded attitude.

                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>As you continue to explore this connection, it's interesting to note that self-acceptance and self-compassion aren't just important for playing pool, but also for building resilience in other areas of your life. By recognizing that it's okay to make mistakes and that you're doing the best you can, you're cultivating a sense of self-compassion that can be applied to other challenges you face. Can you think of a specific situation where you might be able to apply this same mindset?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>That's a really good point. I think one area where I could apply this mindset is when I'm feeling overwhelmed with grading papers and preparing lessons for my art class. Sometimes, I get caught up in perfectionism and feel like I need to create the perfect lesson plan, which can lead to feelings of anxiety and overwhelm. But if I were to focus on building self-acceptance and self-compassion, I would remind myself that it's okay to make mistakes and that I'm doing the best I can. I would focus on the process of creating a great lesson plan, rather than trying to create a perfect one.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're recognizing that the pressure to be perfect can be overwhelming, and that's a really common experience for many people. The research on self-compassion suggests that when we're kind and understanding towards ourselves, even in the midst of imperfection, we're better able to navigate challenges like grading papers and preparing lessons. Can you tell me more about what you think would happen if you were to practice self-compassion when you're feeling stressed about meeting expectations, and how that might impact your overall well-being and performance as a teacher?</div>
