                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Hi Jacklyn, welcome. I'm glad you decided to come in today. To start, could you tell me a bit about what's been going on for you lately?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I just can't seem to shake off this feeling of being completely alone. Even when I try to reach out to friends or engage in my hobbies, the loneliness is always there, especially at night. It feels like nothing I do makes a difference.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like this sense of loneliness has been a persistent and overwhelming feeling for you, and it's affecting your daily life and sense of purpose. I want to acknowledge that it takes a lot of courage to share your experiences with me, and I'm here to listen and support you. Can you help me understand more about what you think might be driving these feelings of loneliness and disconnection, and how you think it might be related to your thoughts about mortality?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I don't know, it just feels like everything is so pointless and meaningless. I'm just going through the motions of daily life, but there's no real purpose or fulfillment. And the thought of being alone at the end of my life, with no one to mourn my passing... it's just so overwhelming and depressing.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>I can sense the depth of your emotional pain and the weight of these feelings on your daily life. It's not uncommon for people to struggle with feelings of purposelessness and disconnection, especially when they're accompanied by thoughts about mortality. It's as if the uncertainty and unpredictability of life can leave us feeling lost and without direction.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I understand what you're saying, but it's hard for me to see any point in trying to change or do anything differently. It's like, what's the use? I'm just going to end up alone anyway, so why bother trying to connect with others or find meaning in my life?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're experiencing a lot of emotional pain and feeling trapped in a sense of hopelessness, and that's a really tough place to be. Can you tell me more about what you mean by what's the use and how that's connected to your feelings of loneliness and mortality?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I guess I just feel like I'm stuck in this rut and no matter how hard I try, I'll never be able to change my circumstances. It's like I'm just a leaf blowing in the wind, without any control or direction. And the thought of being alone for the rest of my life is just so crushing. It's like, what's the point of even trying to make connections with others or pursue my passions when I'm just going to end up alone anyway?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're carrying a significant weight of feeling overwhelmed and powerless, and that's a really understandable response to the circumstances you're facing. Can you help me understand what you think might be the root of this feeling of powerlessness, and how you think it might be impacting your daily life?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think it's just that I've always been independent and self-sufficient, and I've never really had to rely on others for support. So, when I had that health scare and realized I had no one to turn to, it was like a huge wake-up call. It made me realize that I'm not as invincible as I thought I was, and that's really scary.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like this experience has forced you to confront the limits of your control and the uncertainty of life, and that can be a really difficult and humbling realization. Many people struggle with the idea of surrendering to the unknown, especially when they've always relied on their own abilities to navigate challenges. It's like you're facing a crisis of autonomy, and it's understandable that you're feeling lost and uncertain about how to move forward. Can you tell me more about what you mean by being invincible and how that sense of invincibility has been threatened by your recent experiences?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think that's exactly what's been going on. I've always felt like I could handle anything that comes my way, but that health scare and being forced to rely on others for support really shook me. It made me realize that I'm not as self-sufficient as I thought I was, and that's hard for me to accept. I feel like I'm losing control, and that's a really scary feeling.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It's interesting to explore this dynamic between your sense of invincibility and the feeling of losing control. It sounds like this experience has been a significant disruption to your usual way of navigating challenges, and it's understandable that you're struggling to adapt to this new reality. Can you help me understand what you think this sense of invincibility has meant to you in terms of your overall sense of purpose and direction in life?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think that sense of invincibility was a way for me to cope with the uncertainty of life. It was like, as long as I could handle everything on my own, I didn't have to worry about what others thought or whether they would be there for me. But now that I've had to rely on others, I'm realizing that I'm not as in control as I thought I was, and that's really hard for me to accept.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It's interesting that you mention feeling like you're losing your sense of control and autonomy. Can you help me understand what that loss feels like to you, and what specific aspects of your life are feeling out of control right now?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think that sense of invincibility was a way for me to avoid feeling vulnerable and open to others. It was like, as long as I could handle everything on my own, I didn't have to risk getting hurt or rejected by others. But now that I'm facing the reality of my mortality and the possibility of being alone, I'm forced to confront the fact that I'm not as self-sufficient as I thought I was. It's like, I've been living in a fantasy world where I thought I was invincible, but now I'm facing the harsh truth that I'm not.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>As you've shared with me, it's clear that this sense of invincibility has been deeply tied to your sense of identity and control. It's not uncommon for people to struggle with the idea of vulnerability and openness, as it can feel like a threat to their sense of autonomy.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I'm starting to realize that my sense of invincibility was a coping mechanism to avoid the uncertainty and unpredictability of life. It was a way to maintain control and avoid feeling vulnerable. But now that I've faced the reality of my mortality and the possibility of being alone, I'm forced to confront the fact that I'm not as self-sufficient as I thought I was. It's scary to acknowledge that I'm not invincible, but at the same time, I'm starting to understand that it's okay to be vulnerable and that it's a necessary part of forming real connections with others.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>As you're acknowledging the ways in which your sense of invincibility was a coping mechanism, it's interesting to consider how this newfound awareness can actually be a catalyst for growth and deeper connections with others. By embracing vulnerability and openness, you may find that you're able to form more authentic and meaningful relationships, and that you're better equipped to handle life's uncertainties and challenges. Can you help me understand what you think it would take for you to start taking small steps towards embracing vulnerability, and what kind of support system you might need to help you stay on that path?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I'm not sure, it's like I've been living in this fantasy world where I thought I was invincible, but now I'm facing the harsh truth that I'm not. It's scary to acknowledge that I'm not invincible, but at the same time, I'm starting to understand that it's okay to be vulnerable and that it's a necessary part of forming real connections with others.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It's interesting that you mention the fear of losing your sense of identity and purpose. I think that's a really common concern when we start to let go of our need for control and embrace vulnerability. It's as if we're wondering, Who will I be if I'm not this invincible person? And that can be a really scary thought. Can you help me understand what you think it would mean for you to let go of that need for control and what kind of identity or purpose you might find in the process of embracing vulnerability?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I don't know, it feels like a huge part of my identity is wrapped up in being this independent, self-sufficient person. If I let go of that need for control, what does that mean for who I am? I feel like I'm losing my sense of self, and that's a really scary thought.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>As you continue to explore this newfound awareness of your need for control and independence, it's important to remember that it's a common and natural part of human development to question and re-evaluate our sense of self and purpose. In fact, many people find that this process of surrendering control and embracing vulnerability can be a powerful catalyst for personal growth and transformation. By reframing your identity and sense of purpose, you may find that you're able to tap into a deeper sense of connection and fulfillment that's not dependent on being in control all the time.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I'm really struggling to see how embracing vulnerability could be a good thing. It feels like giving up control and putting myself at risk of getting hurt. I'm scared to let go of my sense of invincibility because it's all I've ever known. I don't know who I would be without it.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>As you consider the possibility of embracing vulnerability, I want to acknowledge that it's a big ask, and it's understandable that you might feel uncertain or even scared about what that would look like in your daily life and relationships. Can you help me understand what you think would be the most challenging part of taking small steps towards vulnerability, and what kind of support or resources do you think you would need to feel more comfortable with that?</div>

                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>As you're weighing the pros and cons of taking a step towards vulnerability, I want to acknowledge that it's understandable to feel uncertain and even scared about the potential risks involved. It's as if you're caught between the comfort of your current sense of control and the unknown possibilities of opening up to others. Can you help me understand what you think would be the most frightening or unsettling part of taking a small step towards vulnerability, and how do you think that might impact your daily life and relationships?</div>

                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>As you've described this feeling of being a leaf in the wind, it sounds like it's not just about lacking control, but also about feeling disconnected from your sense of purpose and identity. Can you help me understand how this sense of disconnection is impacting your relationships and daily activities, and if you've noticed any patterns or triggers that tend to make you feel more like a leaf in the wind?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think what's been holding me back is this deep-seated fear of being alone and unloved. I've always put up a tough exterior to avoid getting hurt, but now I'm starting to realize that it's just a facade. I'm scared to let my guard down and be vulnerable because I don't know how others will react. But at the same time, I'm tired of living in this numb, isolating world where I'm just going through the motions. I want to connect with others and have meaningful relationships, but I'm afraid of getting hurt or rejected.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're carrying a heavy burden of fear and uncertainty, and it's understandable that you're struggling to let your guard down and be vulnerable. It's as if you're torn between the desire for human connection and the fear of being hurt or rejected. Many people struggle with this fear of intimacy, and it's not uncommon for it to manifest in ways that feel restrictive and isolating. Can you help me understand what you think would happen if you were to take a small step towards vulnerability, and what kind of support system do you think you would need to feel more comfortable with that?</div>
