                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Hello Monica, it's nice to meet you. How are you feeling today?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I’m just really overwhelmed by these feelings of anxiety at work. It’s like I can’t shake the fear that every customer interaction will go badly, even though I try my best.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're carrying a heavy burden of anxiety with you, especially when you're at work, and that's really understandable. Many people struggle with anxiety, and it's common to feel like you're constantly on edge, waiting for something to go wrong. Can you tell me more about what you think might happen if a customer interaction doesn't go well? Is there a specific fear or worry that comes up for you in those moments?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Honestly, I'm petrified that they'll yell at me, or maybe even complain to my manager about me. The thought of being embarrassed in front of my coworkers and feeling like I've failed as a sales associate is just overwhelming.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It's understandable that you'd feel this way, given the high-stress environment and the pressure to perform well. Can you tell me more about what you do in those moments when you're feeling anxious about a customer interaction? Are there any specific strategies or coping mechanisms that help you feel more grounded and confident?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah, I try to take a few deep breaths and remind myself that I've done this before, and it's okay if things don't go perfectly. I also make sure to focus on the customer's needs and try to stay calm, but it's hard to shake off the feeling that I'm going to mess up.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>I totally get why you'd feel that way, Monica. It sounds like you're really trying to balance your own anxiety with the need to be supportive and helpful to your customers, and that can be a really challenging tightrope to walk. Can you tell me more about what you think would happen if you didn't manage to pull it together and the customer did yell at you or complain to your manager? What would that mean for you, and how do you think it would affect your sense of self-worth?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah, I think it would be devastating. I would feel like I've failed not just as a sales associate, but as a person. I would probably beat myself up over it for days, replaying the interaction in my head, thinking about all the things I could've done differently. It would be hard to shake off the feeling of inadequacy, and I think it would affect my relationships with my coworkers too. I might start to withdraw from social interactions at work, or become even more anxious around customers. It's a really scary thought.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It's understandable that you'd feel this way, given the high stakes and the pressure to perform well. Many people struggle with feelings of inadequacy and self-doubt, especially when they're in situations where they're worried about making mistakes.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah, I think it would be devastating. I would feel like I've failed not just as a sales associate, but as a person.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like this fear of failure is deeply tied to your sense of identity and self-worth, and it's affecting your ability to feel confident and competent in your role as a sales associate. Can you help me understand what you think would happen if you were to make a mistake or not meet your own expectations? Would you be able to learn from it and move forward, or would it be a catastrophic failure in your mind?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>That's a tough question, but I think if I made a mistake, I would replay it over and over in my head, wondering what I could have done differently, and I would probably feel like I've let myself down. It would be hard for me to see past that mistake and move forward, because it would feel like it defines me as a person.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It's interesting to me that you're holding yourself to such high standards, and that the fear of not meeting those expectations is causing you so much distress. Can you tell me more about what you think would happen if you were to make a mistake or not meet your own expectations? How do you think that would impact your sense of self-worth and identity?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>It's funny, I never thought about it that way, but I guess I do hold myself to these really high standards. I'm not sure where that comes from, but I think it's because I'm scared of not being good enough. I'm scared of being seen as incompetent or lazy. I don't know how to quiet that voice in my head that tells me I'm not good enough, and it's exhausting trying to live up to these expectations all the time.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It's not uncommon for people to struggle with perfectionism and the fear of not being good enough, and it's often rooted in a desire to earn approval and validation from others. Can you tell me more about what you think would happen if you were to let go of some of these expectations and just focus on doing your best, rather than trying to be perfect?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah, I think it would be really hard to let go of those expectations, because they're tied to my sense of identity and self-worth. I've always defined myself as someone who is competent and capable, and the thought of not being those things is really scary. But at the same time, I know that holding onto these expectations is exhausting and it's affecting my relationships and my overall well-being. I don't know how to balance my desire to be good enough with the need to be kind to myself and allow for imperfection.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're carrying a significant weight of expectation on your shoulders, and it's impacting your daily life in ways that feel overwhelming and exhausting. Can you tell me more about what you think would happen if you were to let go of the need to be perfect and just focus on being present in each moment, rather than trying to meet a certain standard?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think if I were to let go of the need to be perfect, I would feel a sense of relief, but it's hard to imagine a life where I'm not constantly striving to be better. I worry that if I'm not perfect, I'll be seen as incompetent or lazy, and that's a really scary thought. I'm not sure how to reconcile my desire to be good enough with the need to be kind to myself and allow for imperfection.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It's interesting that you mention feeling like you're constantly trying to prove yourself, and that perfectionism is a big part of that. Can you tell me more about what you think would happen if you were to let go of that need to prove yourself, and just focus on doing your best?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think that would be a huge relief, but it's hard to imagine a life where I'm not constantly striving to be better. I worry that if I'm not perfect, I'll be seen as incompetent or lazy, and that's a really scary thought.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It's not uncommon for people to tie their sense of self-worth to their performance, especially in high-pressure roles like yours. Can you help me understand what you think would happen if you were to separate your self-worth from your job performance, and focus on being kind to yourself regardless of the outcome?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think that would be a huge relief, but it's hard to imagine a life where I'm not constantly striving to be better. I worry that if I'm not perfect, I'll be seen as incompetent or lazy, and that's a really scary thought. But at the same time, I'm tired of feeling like I'm stuck in this cycle of perfectionism and anxiety. I want to learn how to be kind to myself and accept that I'm not perfect, but it's hard to know where to start.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It's interesting that you're noticing this pattern of thinking, where you're worried about being seen as incompetent or lazy if you're not perfect. This critical inner voice can be really pervasive and ingrained, but it's not necessarily a reflection of your actual abilities or worth as a person. Can you help me understand what you think would happen if you were to challenge this voice and remind yourself that it's okay to make mistakes and learn from them?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think that would be a huge relief, but it's hard to imagine a life where I'm not constantly striving to be better.

                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It's fascinating to see how this pattern of perfectionism and anxiety has become intertwined with your sense of identity and self-worth. Can you help me understand what you think would happen if you were to untangle this knot and separate your self-worth from your job performance? What would be the benefits of creating a sense of self-worth that is not dependent on being perfect?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think it's hard for me to imagine a life where I'm not constantly striving to be better, because it's been a part of my identity for so long.

I want to learn how to be kind to myself and accept that I'm not perfect, but it's hard to know where to start. I feel like I'm at a crossroads, where I need to make a choice between continuing down this path of perfectionism or finding a new way to live.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>As you've shared, it's as if you're torn between the desire for perfection and the need for self-care. It's fascinating to explore how these two opposing forces can coexist within you. Can you help me understand what you think would happen if you were to start small, just taking one tiny step towards embracing imperfection, and what kind of self-care practices you think would support you in that process?</div>
