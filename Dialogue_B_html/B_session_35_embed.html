                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Hi Trent, Iâ€™m glad you could make it today. How are you feeling right now as we start our session?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I'm feeling a bit anxious, like I mentioned. It's just hard to open up about these things, especially since I've been dealing with it for so long.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>I get the sense that you're feeling a bit overwhelmed by these emotions, and it's no wonder given the duration and impact they've had on your life. Can you help me better understand what's going through your mind when you're in a social situation and you feel like you're about to freeze up? Is there a particular trigger or thought that always seems to precede those feelings of anxiety?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah, I think so. When I'm in a social situation, I start to feel like I'm being judged or evaluated by others, and that they're all thinking about how awkward I am or how I'm not fitting in. And then my mind starts racing with all these negative thoughts about myself, like I'm not good enough, I'm not interesting, or I'm just going to mess everything up. Those thoughts just spiral out of control and make me feel like I need to escape or hide.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It's interesting that you're noticing these self-critical thoughts, and it sounds like it's affecting your ability to connect with others. Can you help me understand what you mean by mess everything up? What specific situations or scenarios have you worried about in the past, and how have they played out? By gaining a better understanding of what's driving these fears, we may be able to work together to develop some strategies to help you feel more confident and comfortable in social situations.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah, I can recall a few instances where I felt like I was going to mess everything up because I stumbled over my words or said something awkward. It was like I was catastrophizing, thinking that others would judge me harshly or that I'd make a fool of myself. These thoughts would swirl in my head, making me feel anxious and self-conscious, and I'd often find myself withdrawing from the conversation or situation to avoid feeling even more embarrassed.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It's interesting that you mention having a constant voice in your head, always questioning your abilities and making you doubt yourself. Can you help me understand what triggers these thoughts, and do you notice any common themes or patterns in what you're saying to yourself?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah, I think that voice in my head is a constant companion, always whispering negative thoughts and doubts. It's hard to pinpoint exactly what triggers those thoughts, but I think it might be when I'm in situations where I feel like I'm not in control or when I'm forced to interact with people who are more outgoing or confident than me. Those are the times when I feel like I'm being judged or evaluated, and my mind starts racing with all these negative thoughts about myself. I've tried to talk to my friends about it, but they don't really understand what it's like to have those thoughts constantly playing in your head.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It's as if you've been carrying this weight of self-doubt and criticism for a while now, and it's not only affecting your social interactions but also your overall sense of self-worth. Can you tell me more about what you think might be driving this critical inner voice and how it's impacting your daily life?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah, I think it's like I've been carrying this weight of self-doubt and criticism for a while now, and it's not only affecting my social interactions but also my overall sense of self-worth.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>I can totally understand why this constant self-criticism would be exhausting and overwhelming, and it's amazing that you've been able to acknowledge and recognize its impact on your life. Can you help me understand what you think you've learned about yourself through this process of self-criticism and self-doubt? Are there any patterns or themes that you've noticed in how you treat yourself or how you perceive yourself in these situations, and do you think that might be connected to any childhood experiences or relationships that have shaped your sense of self?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah, I think that's a good point. I've been carrying this weight of self-doubt and criticism for a while now, and it's not only affecting my social interactions but also my overall sense of self-worth. It's like I'm constantly trying to prove myself to others, but I'm also beating myself up over every little thing I do or say. It's exhausting, and I feel like I'm stuck in this cycle of negativity and self-criticism.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It's really interesting that you've acknowledged the impact of this self-criticism on your relationships and sense of self-worth. Research suggests that self-compassion is a powerful tool in breaking free from these patterns, as it allows us to develop a more accepting and understanding relationship with ourselves. Would you be open to exploring some strategies for cultivating self-compassion, and seeing how that might shift your experience of self-doubt and criticism?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah, I can see how self-compassion could be helpful in breaking free from these patterns of self-doubt and criticism. It's like I've been so focused on trying to be perfect and avoid making mistakes that I've forgotten how to be kind to myself when I mess up. I'm willing to explore these strategies, but I'm also a bit nervous about it because I'm not sure if I can really change my thought patterns and behaviors.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you've been carrying this weight of self-criticism for a long time, and it's affecting not only your social interactions but also your overall sense of self-worth. Can you tell me more about what you think drives this need to prove yourself to others, and how you think it might be connected to your self-criticism?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think my need to prove myself to others might be rooted in a fear of being rejected or deemed unworthy. As a child, I often felt like I wasn't good enough or that I wasn't meeting my parents' expectations, so I developed this need to constantly prove myself to them and others. It's like I'm trying to earn their approval and validation, and if I don't meet those expectations, I feel like I'm a failure. This need for validation has carried over into my adult life, where I feel like I'm constantly trying to prove myself to others, whether it's through my work or my relationships.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like this fear of rejection and need for validation has been a persistent theme throughout your life, and it's driving a sense of disconnection from your true self. Can you help me understand what you think would happen if you were able to cultivate a sense of self-acceptance and self-compassion, rather than constantly seeking validation from others?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>It's like, I've been carrying this weight of self-criticism for so long that it's hard to imagine what it would be like to not have that constant voice in my head. But at the same time, I'm tired of feeling like I'm stuck in this cycle of negativity and self-doubt. I'm willing to try anything to break free from it, even if it's scary or uncomfortable. Can we work on building a sense of self-compassion and self-acceptance together?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>I can sense that this self-criticism has been a part of your life for a long time, and it's amazing that you're recognizing the toll it's taking on your mental health. It's not uncommon for people to struggle with self-acceptance, especially when they're used to being hard on themselves. Building self-compassion takes time and practice, but it's a valuable investment in your overall well-being. Would you like to explore some specific situations where you've felt this self-criticism creeping in, and see if we can identify any patterns or triggers that might be contributing to it?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think I've been carrying this weight of self-criticism for so long that it's hard to imagine what it would be like to not have that constant voice in my head.

I'd like to build on that by exploring some potential strategies for cultivating more self-compassion. Can you tell me more about what you think would be the most challenging part of letting go of your need for external validation and embracing self-acceptance, and how you think we might be able to work together to overcome that challenge?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah, I think it's like, I've been carrying this weight of self-criticism for so long that it's hard to imagine what it would be like to not have that constant voice in my head.

                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>As we've been exploring, it's clear that this self-criticism has been a deeply ingrained pattern for you, and it's affecting not just your relationships but also your sense of self-worth. Let's take a step back and consider what small, manageable steps you might take to begin shifting towards more self-compassion. Can you think of one specific situation or experience where you'd like to practice being kinder to yourself, and what small action might you take to make that happen?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think it's interesting that you're framing this as a process of building self-compassion, rather than just trying to eliminate the self-criticism. It's like, I've been so focused on trying to be perfect and avoid making mistakes that I've forgotten how to be kind to myself when I mess up. I'm willing to explore this idea of self-compassion and see how it might shift my experience of self-doubt and criticism.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>As you've been recognizing the impact of self-criticism on your relationships and sense of self-worth, I'm curious, what do you think it would mean for you to practice self-compassion in those moments when you're feeling self-critical, and how might that impact your overall sense of well-being and relationships?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think it would mean acknowledging that I'm not perfect and that it's okay to make mistakes. It would mean being kinder to myself and treating myself with the same kindness and understanding that I would offer to a friend who is going through a tough time. I think it would help me to develop a more positive and compassionate relationship with myself, and that would likely have a positive impact on my relationships with others as well.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It seems like acknowledging the common humanity aspect could be a powerful tool in reframing your self-criticism. Can you imagine how it might feel to recognize that your struggles with self-doubt and criticism are not unique to you, but rather a normal part of the human experience? What do you think would be the first step for you in applying this concept to your own life, and how might that shift your relationship with self-criticism?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think I can see how acknowledging that my struggles with self-doubt and criticism are not unique to me could be a powerful tool in reframing my self-criticism.

                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It's not unusual for people to struggle with self-criticism, and it's actually a sign of strength that you're recognizing its impact on your life and willing to explore ways to shift your perspective. By acknowledging that self-criticism is a common experience, we can start to work together to develop a more compassionate and understanding relationship with yourself. What do you think would be the most important step in making this shift, and how do you envision yourself practicing self-compassion in daily life?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think it's interesting that you're framing this as a process of building self-compassion, rather than just trying to eliminate the self-criticism.

                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>As you've acknowledged the impact of self-criticism on your relationships and sense of self-worth, I'd like to gently challenge your assumption that you need to be perfect to be loved and accepted. What if, instead of striving for perfection, you focus on being your authentic self, with all your flaws and imperfections? How might that shift your relationships and daily life, and what do you think would be the most challenging part of embracing this new perspective?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think that's a really interesting perspective, and it's something I've been struggling with for a long time. I've always felt like I need to be perfect and in control in order to be loved and accepted, but that's just not realistic. I'm willing to work on accepting myself and my flaws, but it's hard for me to let go of that need for perfection. I feel like it's a big part of my identity, and I'm not sure who I would be without it.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>I'm struck by how much energy you're expending to maintain this image of perfection, and how it's taking a toll on your relationships and overall well-being. It seems like you're trying to prove something to yourself or others, and that's leaving you feeling exhausted and unsatisfied. Can you help me understand what you think would happen if you were able to let go of this need for perfection and instead focus on being genuine and authentic? How do you think that would impact your relationships and daily life, and what would it mean for you to be truly yourself?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think it would mean embracing my imperfections and not trying to control everything. It would mean being okay with making mistakes and not beating myself up over them. I think it would mean being more authentic and genuine in my relationships, and not trying to put on a perfect facade. It would mean being more comfortable in my own skin and not constantly striving for perfection.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>What I hear you saying is that there's a sense of relief and hope emerging as we explore the possibility of releasing the need for perfection and embracing your authentic self. It sounds like you're starting to imagine what that might look like in your daily life and relationships. Can you help me understand what specifically is drawing you towards this idea of being genuine and authentic, and what you think would be the most challenging part of making that shift?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Thank you for helping me see that my self-criticism is not unique to me and that it's a common experience for many people. It's been really eye-opening to realize that I've been carrying this weight of self-doubt and criticism for so long, and it's exhausting. I'm willing to work on building self-compassion and self-acceptance, but it's hard for me to imagine what that would look like in my daily life.

                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It's remarkable how self-compassion can be a game-changer, not just for our mental health, but also for our relationships and sense of self-worth.
