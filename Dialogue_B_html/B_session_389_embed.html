                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Hi Charles, it's nice to meet you. How are you feeling today?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Honestly, I'm feeling pretty down about my writing. I just can't shake off this belief that I'm not good enough, no matter what I do.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It can be really tough to deal with self-doubt, especially when it's affecting something you're passionate about like writing. Can you help me understand more about what you mean by not being good enough? Is it that you feel like your work isn't being appreciated or recognized, or is it more about the internal struggle you face when you're writing?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>To be honest, it's a bit of both. I feel like my writing isn't good enough because I'm not getting published, and when I do get feedback, it's always something negative. It's like, no matter what I do, I'm just not good enough. It's hard to explain, but it's like this constant feeling of inadequacy that's always lurking in the back of my mind.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Can you help me understand what you think would be the next step for you to take in your writing career that would validate your worth as a writer, and what would happen if you took that step?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I'm not sure, I guess I'd like to be published and have people recognize my work, but at the same time, I'm scared of being rejected again and proving to myself that I'm indeed not good enough. It's a vicious cycle, and I don't know how to break it.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like the fear of rejection has become a major obstacle for you, and it's affecting your ability to take risks and move forward with your writing. Can you help me understand what you think would happen if you were to publish something and receive positive feedback? Would that somehow validate your worth as a writer, or are there still other factors that would keep you feeling uncertain?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>It's hard for me to imagine that even if I were to publish something and receive positive feedback, it wouldn't change the way I feel about my writing. I think that's because the doubts and fears have been ingrained in my mind for so long, and it's hard for me to shake them off.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're experiencing a lot of self-doubt and uncertainty about your writing, and that's making it hard for you to take steps forward. Can you tell me more about what you think would happen if you were able to quiet that inner critic and focus on the process of creating, rather than worrying about the outcome?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah, I guess it's hard for me to imagine that I could ever be good enough, no matter what happens. It's like, even if I do somehow manage to publish something and get positive feedback, I'll just find another way to doubt myself. It's a never-ending cycle, and I don't know how to break free from it.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It's interesting to note that this self-doubt seems to be deeply entwined with your sense of identity as a writer, and that it's not just limited to your writing, but also affects other areas of your life. Can you confirm if that's what you're experiencing, and if so, how do you think this self-doubt has impacted your daily life and relationships?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think it's true, my self-doubt has seeped into other areas of my life, like my relationships with fellow writers. I've become really defensive and critical of their work, and I've started to withdraw from social gatherings because I feel like I don't belong. It's like, even when I'm not writing, I'm still stuck in this negative thought pattern.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It's interesting to me that you're noticing this connection between your self-doubt and your relationships with fellow writers. It's almost as if your critical inner voice is trying to protect you from feeling vulnerable and exposed, but in doing so, it's actually causing you to isolate yourself and miss out on potential connections and support. Can you help me understand what you think would happen if you were to let go of that critical inner voice and take a risk to share your own work with others, even if it's just in a small way?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah, I guess it's hard for me to imagine that I could ever be good enough, no matter what happens. It's like, even if I do somehow manage to publish something and get positive feedback, I'll just find another way to doubt myself. It's a never-ending cycle, and I don't know how to break free from it.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It's interesting to me that this feeling of not being good enough has been present for so long, and it's had such a profound impact on your life. Can you help me understand what you think would happen if you were to write a letter to your younger self, saying I am enough, just as I am, with all my strengths and weaknesses? What do you think that would be like for you to write and what do you think would be the aftermath of sharing that letter with yourself?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I'm not sure, it's hard for me to imagine that I could ever be good enough, no matter what happens.

                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like this critical inner voice has been a constant companion for you, and it's understandable that it's made you feel stuck and uncertain about your writing and sense of self. Can you help me understand what you think would happen if you were to start to challenge and reframe some of these negative thoughts, rather than believing them as facts?</div>

                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It's interesting that you mention the need for perfection in your writing, and how that's led to a sense of self-criticism and negative self-talk. Can you help me understand what you think would happen if you were to reframe your writing as an process rather than an end product, and focus on the enjoyment and discovery that comes from writing, rather than the need for perfection? How might that change your experience of writing and your relationship with your critical inner voice?</div>

                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It's interesting to me that you've been carrying this weight of self-doubt and criticism around for so long, and it's affecting not just your writing but also your sense of self-worth. Can you help me understand what you think would happen if you were to start to separate your identity as a writer from your identity as a person, and focus on the former as a hobby or passion rather than a reflection of your self-worth?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I feel like I'm stuck in this pattern of self-doubt and criticism, and I don't know how to escape it. I've been trying to change my thoughts and behaviors, but it seems like no matter what I do, I'm still stuck in this negative thought pattern. I feel like I'm losing myself in this process, and I don't know how to find my way back to a more positive and confident self.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It's fascinating how our critical inner voice can shape our perceptions of ourselves, making it challenging to break free from these negative patterns. Research suggests that self-compassion can be a powerful tool in combating self-doubt and criticism, by acknowledging that our struggles are a natural part of the human experience. Would you be willing to explore some strategies for cultivating self-compassion, and how that might impact your relationship with your critical inner voice?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I understand where you're coming from, but it's hard for me to imagine a scenario where I wouldn't doubt myself, even if I do achieve some level of success. It's like, no matter what happens, I'll always find a way to criticize myself. I feel like I'm stuck in this vicious cycle, and I don't know how to escape it.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It's interesting that you're noticing this pattern of self-criticism and negative thinking, and how it's affecting not just your writing but also your sense of self-worth. Research suggests that when we're kind and understanding towards ourselves, even in the midst of struggle, we can start to shift the balance of power away from our critical inner voice. Would you be willing to explore some strategies for cultivating self-compassion, and how that might impact your relationship with your critical inner voice?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I understand why you're trying to help me, but I just can't shake off this feeling that I'm not good enough.

                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think I'm starting to realize that I've been giving my critical inner voice way too much power over my life. It's like, I've been letting it dictate my thoughts and feelings, and it's been holding me back from pursuing my passions and living the life I want. I'm starting to see that it's not about being good enough or not good enough, but about being kind and compassionate towards myself, no matter what.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>As you recognize the impact of giving your critical inner voice too much power, it's essential to understand that this is a common phenomenon, and many people struggle with similar issues. Research suggests that when we develop self-compassion and mindfulness skills, we can learn to rewire our brains and reduce the influence of this critical inner voice. Would you be interested in exploring some mindfulness exercises and strategies to help you cultivate a more compassionate and accepting relationship with yourself?</div>
