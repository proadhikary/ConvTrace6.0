                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Hi Nancy, I'm glad you're here today. How are you feeling about this session?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I'm feeling a mix of nervousness and hope. I really want to address this self-doubt I've been experiencing.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like this self-doubt is deeply tied to your sense of identity and purpose as a teacher, and it's impacting your overall well-being. Can you help me understand what you think would be the most helpful step for you to take to start building back your confidence and sense of self?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think understanding the root cause of this self-doubt is crucial. I believe it might be related to the competitive environment among teachers at my school, as you mentioned. I would like to explore this further and discuss ways to address it.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It's interesting that you mention the competitive environment at your school, and I can see how that could definitely contribute to feelings of self-doubt. Can you help me understand more about what you think would happen if you were able to reduce that competition and focus more on collaboration with your colleagues? How do you think that would impact your sense of confidence and ability to teach effectively?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think if I were able to reduce the competition and focus more on collaboration with my colleagues, I would feel more supported and less isolated. This would allow me to focus on building strong relationships with my students and colleagues, rather than constantly comparing myself to others. I believe this would help me regain my confidence and sense of self-worth as a teacher, and ultimately improve my teaching performance.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It's interesting to me that you bring up the idea of focusing on collaboration with colleagues, because often when we're in competitive environments, we can start to feel like we're alone in our struggles. Can you tell me more about what you think would be the biggest benefit of shifting your focus from competition to collaboration, and how that might look in your daily work?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think the biggest benefit of shifting my focus from competition to collaboration would be the sense of community and support that I would feel. I would no longer feel like I'm in a constant battle with my colleagues, and I would be able to focus on building strong relationships with them and my students. This would also allow me to learn from others and share my own experiences and knowledge, which would help me grow as a teacher.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It's interesting to me that you mention wanting to learn from others and share your own expertise. I think that's a great way to frame collaboration, rather than just seeing it as a means to an end. Can you tell me more about what you think you would gain from learning from your colleagues and how you think that would impact your teaching practice?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think learning from my colleagues would allow me to gain a deeper understanding of their teaching styles and strengths, which would help me to identify areas where I can improve my own teaching practice. Additionally, sharing my own experiences and knowledge would help me to build trust and respect with my colleagues, which would create a more positive and supportive environment in the classroom.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're really starting to uncover the ways in which the competitive school environment has been taking a toll on your mental health and overall well-being. It's amazing how much of an impact it can have on our sense of self and confidence, isn't it? Can you tell me more about what you think would happen if you were able to create a more collaborative environment in your school, and how that might look in terms of specific changes or initiatives?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think creating a more collaborative environment in my school would require some intentional changes, such as implementing team-building activities, encouraging peer feedback and support, and fostering open communication among teachers. Additionally, I would like to explore the possibility of mentoring or coaching programs that pair experienced teachers with newer or struggling teachers to provide guidance and support.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>As you explore these ideas for creating a more collaborative environment, I want to acknowledge that it can be daunting to make significant changes, especially when it feels like it's going against the grain of the school's culture. Can you tell me more about what you think would be the biggest challenges for you in making these changes, and how you think you might approach overcoming those challenges?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I can see how I've been focusing on the negative aspects of the competitive environment and how it's impacting my self-doubt. I think the biggest challenge for me would be addressing the resistance I might face from some colleagues who are used to the current competitive culture. I would need to find ways to communicate the benefits of collaboration effectively and engage with colleagues who are open to change. Additionally, I would need to be willing to compromise and adapt to the needs of others, which could be difficult for me as I tend to be a perfectionist.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>As you explore the idea of creating a more collaborative environment, it's clear that you're thinking about the potential benefits and challenges. It's understandable that you might feel daunted by the thought of making significant changes, especially when it comes to addressing resistance from colleagues. Can you tell me more about what you think would be the most important thing for you to focus on in order to make progress towards creating a more collaborative culture?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think what's most important for me to focus on is building a sense of trust and respect with my colleagues, which would allow me to establish a foundation for collaboration. I believe that if I can create a positive and supportive environment, it would be easier to address the competitive culture and focus on mutual growth and learning. I also think that being open to feedback and willing to adapt to the needs of others would be crucial in overcoming the challenges of creating a more collaborative environment.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>As you think about what specific actions you can take to build trust and respect with your colleagues, I want to acknowledge that it's not always easy to know where to start. It's almost like trying to write a new script for yourself, replacing the old patterns of competition with new ones of collaboration and support. What are some specific scenarios or interactions that you think would be particularly powerful for you to focus on in order to start building this new narrative?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think I've been so focused on the negative aspects of the competitive environment and how it's impacting my self-doubt, but it's helpful to start thinking about what a more collaborative environment would look like. I can see how building trust and respect with my colleagues would be a crucial first step. I would like to start by volunteering for a school committee or task force that focuses on teacher collaboration and professional development. This would allow me to work alongside colleagues who share my vision for a more collaborative environment and help me build relationships with them. Additionally, I would like to start having open and honest conversations with my colleagues about the benefits of collaboration and how it can improve our teaching practice and student outcomes.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It's really impressive how you're taking a proactive approach to creating a more collaborative environment at your school. Building trust and respect with colleagues is definitely a key component of that. Can you tell me more about what you think are some specific behaviors or actions that you could take to demonstrate your commitment to collaboration and mutual support? For example, are there any particular strategies or techniques that you've used in the past that have helped you build stronger relationships with your colleagues?</div>

I'm curious, what do you think would be the most significant benefit of creating a more collaborative environment, not just for your own well-being, but also for the students and the school as a whole?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think if we could create a more collaborative environment at my school, it would lead to a more positive and supportive culture, which would ultimately benefit the students. When teachers feel supported and valued, they're more likely to be engaged and motivated, which would result in better teaching practices and improved student outcomes. Additionally, a collaborative environment would allow teachers to share their expertise and learn from each other, which would lead to a more cohesive and effective teaching team.</div>

                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think what would be most helpful for me to feel like I'm truly part of a collaborative team is the sense of trust and respect that I'm building with my colleagues.

                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I appreciate the counselor's encouragement and support in exploring the root cause of my self-doubt.
