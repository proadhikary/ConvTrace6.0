                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Hello Martha, itâ€™s nice to meet you. What brings you here today?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I'm here because I'm experiencing extreme anxiety and fear about my position in the church choir. It's gotten to the point where it's affecting my daily life.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It's interesting that you mention feeling like you're no longer the same person when you're singing in the choir. Can you help me understand what that means to you? How has your sense of self changed since you started feeling anxious and fearful about singing, and what do you think is missing from your experience that's making it feel so different?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I don't know, it's just that I feel like I'm losing myself in all this anxiety and fear. I used to love singing and now it feels like a chore. I'm always worried about making mistakes and that's taking away from the joy I used to get from it. And to be honest, I'm not even sure why I'm doing it anymore. It feels like just going through the motions.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It's fascinating to explore how your experience of singing has shifted over time, from a source of joy and connection to a burden filled with anxiety and worry. It's almost as if the very thing that was once a vital part of your identity is now causing you to feel disconnected from yourself. Can you tell me more about what you think might be the root cause of this shift, and how you've been coping with the feelings of disconnection and inauthenticity that have emerged?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I don't think it's just about the singing itself, it's about the pressure to be perfect and the fear of being judged by others. I feel like I'm constantly walking on eggshells, trying not to make any mistakes, and it's exhausting. And even when I do manage to get through a song without messing up, it's like I'm just pretending to be someone I'm not. It's all just a facade, and it's really taking a toll on my mental health.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It's not uncommon for people to feel like they're living a facade when they're under pressure to be perfect, and it's especially challenging when that pressure comes from within. It sounds like you're already aware that this sense of inauthenticity is affecting your enjoyment of singing, and that's a huge step in recognizing the impact it's having on your life. Research suggests that perfectionism can actually lead to increased anxiety and self-doubt, which can be a difficult cycle to break. Would you like to explore some strategies for reframing your expectations around making mistakes and what it means to be perfect in the choir?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I don't know if I can do that. I feel like I'll never be good enough, and everyone will be disappointed in me. It's hard for me to even think about letting go of this perfectionism because it's been a part of me for so long.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It's interesting that you bring up the idea of losing your sense of self-worth if you stop striving for perfection, Martha. Can you help me understand what you think would happen to your sense of identity if you weren't defined by being perfect in the choir? Would you feel lost, or would you discover a new sense of self that's not tied to perfectionism?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I don't know, it's hard for me to even imagine a time when I'm not striving for perfection. I feel like it's a part of who I am, and if I let go of it, I'll lose myself. I'm scared to think about what would happen if I wasn't perfect, because I think it would mean I'm not good enough.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It's as if the pressure to be perfect has become a heavy burden, weighing you down and making it difficult to imagine a life where you can simply enjoy the process of singing, without the constant fear of making a mistake. Can you help me understand what would need to happen for you to feel like you can release some of that pressure and find a sense of freedom in your performances?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I'm scared to let go of perfectionism because it's been a part of me for so long, and I'm worried that I'll lose my sense of identity. I feel like it's a part of who I am, and if I'm not striving for perfection, then I'll be nobody.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It seems that the pressure to be perfect has been a driving force in your life for a while now, and it's interesting that you find yourself stuck between the fear of not being perfect and the fear of letting go of that sense of identity. Can you help me understand what you think would happen if you were to explore this idea of authentic self, and how that might impact your sense of self-worth and your relationship with the choir?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I understand what you're saying, but it's hard for me to imagine a life without perfectionism because it's been a part of me for so long. I feel like it's a part of who I am, and if I'm not striving for perfection, then I'll be nobody. I'm scared to let go of it because I'm worried that I'll lose my sense of identity.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It's clear that the pressure to be perfect has been a significant part of your life for a long time, Martha, and it's understandable that you're hesitant to let go of it. Research suggests that this is a common phenomenon, often referred to as the identity fusion concept. Can you help me understand what you think would happen if you were to gradually start exploring your authentic self, separate from your perfectionism, and how that might impact your sense of identity and relationships with others?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I understand what you're saying, but it's hard for me to imagine a life without perfectionism because it's been a part of me for so long.

                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like the thought of exploring what's underneath your perfectionism is both exciting and terrifying for you, Martha. Can you help me understand what specific fears or concerns you have about letting go of perfectionism, and how you think it might impact your relationships with others and your sense of self?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I'm scared to let go of perfectionism because it's been a part of me for so long, and I'm worried that I'll lose my sense of identity. I feel like it's a part of who I am, and if I'm not striving for perfection, then I'll be nobody. I'm scared to let go of it because I'm worried that I'll lose my sense of self-worth and that others will see me as flawed or imperfect.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>As we explore this fear of losing your sense of identity and self-worth, I want to acknowledge that it's a complex and deeply personal issue, Martha. It's not uncommon for people to struggle with this fear, and it's a sign of strength that you're willing to confront it and work through it.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I understand that you're trying to help me, but it's really hard for me to imagine a life without perfectionism because it's been a part of me for so long. I feel like it's a part of who I am, and if I'm not striving for perfection, then I'll be nobody. I'm scared to let go of it because I'm worried that I'll lose my sense of identity and that others will see me as flawed or imperfect.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It's not uncommon for people to feel a strong attachment to their perfectionism, even if it's causing them distress. In fact, research has shown that perfectionism can be a coping mechanism for people who have a fear of failure or rejection. Would you like to explore how this pattern of thinking might have developed for you, and how it might be maintaining your sense of self?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I don't know, it's just that I've always been someone who strives for perfection, and I don't know who I am without that. It's like, what's the point of doing anything if I'm not going to do it perfectly? And what if others see me as flawed or imperfect? That's just too scary to think about.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It's as if you're carrying the weight of what others might think of you, Martha, and it's understandable that the idea of being imperfect feels like a threat to your sense of self-worth. Can you help me understand what you think would happen if you were to take a step back and evaluate what's truly important to you in your relationships and in your life, beyond the need for perfection?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I feel like I'm stuck in this endless cycle of striving for perfection, and I'm not sure how to break free from it. It's like, I know it's not healthy, but I just can't imagine being anyone else. I'm scared to let go of this perfectionism because I'm worried that I'll lose my sense of identity and that others will see me as flawed or imperfect.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It's fascinating to explore how this pattern of perfectionism has developed for you, Martha. Can you help me understand what you think would happen if you were to reframe these fears and doubts as an opportunity to learn and grow, rather than as threats to your sense of self-worth? How might that shift in perspective impact your experience of singing in the choir and your overall sense of self-acceptance?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I don't know, it's just that I've been carrying this fear of being imperfect for so long that I don't know how to let go of it. I feel like I've been living my whole life according to this idea that I need to be perfect, and it's hard to imagine doing anything differently. I'm scared to let go of my perfectionism because it's a part of who I am, and I don't know who I would be without it.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like the fear of being imperfect is deeply ingrained in your sense of self, Martha, and it's understandable that you're hesitant to let go of it. Research suggests that people who are able to reframe their fears and doubts as opportunities for growth and learning are often more resilient and adaptable in the face of change. Can you help me understand what you think would happen if you were to take small steps towards reframing your fears and doubts, and how that might impact your experience of singing in the choir and your overall sense of self-acceptance?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I'm starting to feel overwhelmed with this idea of reframing my fears and doubts. It's hard for me to imagine a life where I'm not striving for perfection, and I'm worried that if I let go of it, I'll lose my sense of identity. I don't know how to take small steps towards this, because it feels like such a big change.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Martha, it's really important to acknowledge that the fear of being imperfect is a common experience for many people, and it's not something that you can just snap out of or get over. It's a deeply ingrained pattern of thinking that has developed over time, and it's going to take some effort and practice to work through it. But the good news is that you're already taking the first step by recognizing that this pattern is holding you back. By acknowledging and accepting your fear of being imperfect, you can start to develop a more compassionate relationship with yourself, and that can help you build the confidence and self-acceptance you need to take small steps towards reframing your fears and doubts.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I don't know, it just feels like I'm stuck in this endless cycle of striving for perfection, and I'm not sure how to break free from it.

I'm scared to let go of this perfectionism because I'm worried that I'll lose my sense of identity and that others will see me as flawed or imperfect.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Martha, it's as if you're caught in a cycle of self-doubt, where the fear of being imperfect has become a constant companion. Research suggests that this is a common phenomenon, and it's not uncommon for people to struggle with the pressure to be perfect. By reframing your fears and doubts, you might be surprised to find that it's not so much about being perfect, but about embracing the process of growth and learning. Would you be willing to explore what that might look like for you, and how it could impact your experience of singing in the choir and your overall sense of self-acceptance?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I don't know, it feels like I'm at a crossroads right now. I'm torn between my desire to be perfect and my fear of losing myself if I let go of perfectionism. I'm scared to take the first step towards reframing my fears and doubts because it feels like a huge risk. But at the same time, I'm tired of feeling stuck in this endless cycle of striving for perfection. I want to break free from it, but I don't know how.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It's really common to feel like you're at a crossroads when trying to reframe your fears and doubts about perfectionism, Martha. It's as if you're being asked to let go of a part of yourself that's been deeply ingrained, and that can be a really scary prospect. That's why I'd like to propose this exercise: can you try writing down all the negative self-talk and critical inner voices that come up for you when you think about letting go of perfectionism? Sometimes putting those thoughts on paper can help you see them more clearly, and from there, we can start to work on reframing them in a more compassionate and realistic way.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I don't know, it just feels like I'm stuck in this endless cycle of striving for perfection, and I'm not sure how to break free from it. It's like, I know it's not healthy, but I just can't imagine being anyone else. I'm scared to let go of this perfectionism because I'm worried that I'll lose my sense of identity and that others will see me as flawed or imperfect.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Martha, it sounds like you're carrying a heavy burden of self-doubt and fear of imperfection, and it's no wonder that the thought of letting go of perfectionism feels like a daunting task. But I want to reassure you that you're not alone in this struggle. Many people have grappled with the pressure to be perfect and have come out the other side with a newfound sense of self-acceptance and confidence. As we explore this further, let's keep in mind that perfectionism isn't necessarily a definition of who you are as a person. Research suggests that people who are able to reframe their fears and doubts about imperfection are often more resilient and adaptable in the face of change. So, what if we were to take small steps towards reframing your fears and doubts? What would need to shift for you to feel more comfortable with the idea of embracing your imperfections and being okay with making mistakes?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I'm not sure, it's just that I've been carrying this fear of being imperfect for so long that I don't know how to let go of it. I feel like I've been living my whole life according to this idea that I need to be perfect, and it's hard to imagine doing anything differently.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It's as if the weight of your fear of imperfection has been holding you back from exploring a more authentic sense of self, Martha. I want to gently challenge the idea that you need to be perfect, and instead, encourage you to explore what's underneath this need. What do you think would happen if you were to let go of the need to be perfect and focus on the process of learning and growing from your mistakes? How might that shift in perspective impact your experience of singing in the choir and your overall sense of self-acceptance?</div>

Can you help me understand what you think it is about your identity that's tied to being perfect? Is it a sense of control, a sense of accomplishment, or something else entirely?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>It's hard for me to separate my sense of self from my need to be perfect.
