                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Hi Blake, it's nice to meet you. Let's start by discussing why you decided to come in for counseling today.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I just can't stop thinking about it. Every time I try to focus on something else, my mind goes back to the idea that all the concerts I look forward to are going to get canceled. It's really overwhelming.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>I can imagine how unsettling that must be for you. It sounds like you're really passionate about live music, and the thought of it being taken away is really freaking you out. Can you help me understand more about what you think would happen if live music events were to get canceled? Would it be like losing a part of your identity or would it be more about missing out on the experience itself?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah, I guess it would be like losing a part of my identity. I mean, music is a huge part of who I am, and not being able to experience it live would be like losing a piece of myself. It's hard for me to even think about it without getting anxious and feeling like my world is falling apart.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like this fear of losing live music events is not just about the activity itself, but about the sense of purpose and meaning it brings to your life. Can you help me understand more about what this sense of purpose means to you, and how you think you would fill the void if live music events were no longer an option?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I don't know, it's hard to think about a life without live music. It's like, what would I even do with myself? I wouldn't be the same person. I'd be stuck in some boring, routine life without any excitement or passion.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're not just attached to the music itself, but to the sense of community and connection you feel with others when you're attending a live music event. You mentioned that you really value the social aspect of it, and that it's a time when you feel most alive and connected to others. Can you help me understand what specifically about that sense of community and connection is so meaningful to you, and how you think you might be able to find that same sense of connection and belonging in other areas of your life?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I guess I never really thought about it like that. I mean, I do love the social aspect of concerts, but I never realized it was so important to my overall sense of identity. It's like, I didn't even know I was searching for that connection in live music.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Can you help me understand what you mean by a fundamental part of who you are when you think about not finding that sense of connection elsewhere? Is there a specific feeling or sense of identity that you associate with being part of that live music community?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I feel like it's the sense of belonging, you know? It's like, when I'm at a concert, I'm not just listening to the music, I'm surrounded by people who are feeling the same emotions and energy as me. It's like, we're all in this together, and it feels like we're all connected. And if I'm not able to find that sense of connection elsewhere, I feel like I'll be lost and alone. It's like, I'll be searching for something that's missing, but I won't know what it is or how to get it back.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>As you've shared, it's clear that this sense of belonging and connection is deeply intertwined with your sense of identity and self-worth. It's understandable that the thought of losing it would be so distressing for you. Can you help me explore how you think you might be able to reconcile this part of yourself with the reality that you can't always be at live music events?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I don't know...I just can't imagine not being able to experience that sense of connection and belonging with others. It's like, it's such a big part of who I am, and I don't know how I would replace it. I feel like I'm stuck between this fear of losing it and the reality of not being able to have it all the time. It's really frustrating because I want to be able to appreciate the music for what it is, not just the experience, but it's hard when I'm so attached to that sense of community.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It's understandable that you're struggling with this sense of loss, but I want to encourage you to think about it in a more nuanced way. Instead of catastrophizing the idea of losing this sense of community, can we break it down into smaller, manageable pieces? For example, what would it mean to still have this sense of connection and belonging in other areas of your life, even if it's not directly tied to live music events?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I don't know, it's hard to think about a life without live music. It's like, what would I even do with myself? I wouldn't be the same person. I'd be stuck in some boring, routine life without any excitement or passion.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It's interesting that you mention the idea of a life without live music events being almost unimaginable to you. Can you help me understand what you think would happen to your sense of self if you couldn't find ways to connect with others on a deeper level, even if it's not specifically through live music events?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I guess I never thought about it that way. I just always assumed that my sense of identity was tied to my passion for live music, and without it, I'd be lost. But now that you're saying that I can still find ways to connect with others, it's making me realize that there's more to my sense of self than just one thing. It's like, I have other interests and hobbies that could bring me joy and fulfillment too. I just need to explore those and find what works for me.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>As you reflect on the idea that your sense of identity isn't solely tied to live music events, it's clear that this realization is both empowering and unsettling. Can you tell me more about what's driving your anxiety around exploring other interests and hobbies, and how you think that might impact your relationships with others who are still deeply connected to live music?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah, I think I've been so focused on this idea that live music is the only thing that brings me joy and fulfillment, that I haven't really considered what else could bring me those things. It's scary to think about exploring other interests and hobbies because I'm not sure what I'll find, or if I'll be able to connect with others in the same way.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>As you explore these new interests and hobbies, it's possible that you might find that they bring you a sense of joy and fulfillment that's different from what you experience with live music events. What do you think would happen if you were to share these new discoveries with your friends who are also passionate about live music, and how do you think they might react to your newfound interests?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I'm not sure, it's hard for me to imagine right now. I guess I've always assumed that if I'm not talking about live music, I'm not being myself. But now that you're saying that I can find other ways to connect with others, it's making me realize that I don't have to define myself solely by my passion for live music. It's like, I have other interests and hobbies that could bring me joy and fulfillment too.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It's interesting that you mention feeling a sense of loss or disconnection from your old self if you were to pursue these new interests. Can you help me understand what you think would happen if you were to hold onto your old self, versus embracing this new aspect of yourself? How might your relationships with others change, and what kind of support do you think you'd need from friends and family to navigate this transition?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think I've been holding onto my old self, my identity as a live music enthusiast, for so long that I'm scared to let go of it. It's comforting to know that I have this passion, even if it's not always available. But at the same time, I don't want to miss out on other experiences and connections that could bring me joy and fulfillment.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're caught between the comfort of your familiar identity as a live music enthusiast and the uncertainty of exploring new interests and hobbies. It's understandable that you're hesitant to let go of what's familiar, but it's also exciting to consider the possibility of discovering new passions and connections. Can we talk more about what would make you feel more comfortable with the idea of branching out and exploring these new interests, and what kind of support do you think you'd need from others to feel more confident in this transition?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think I've been so focused on this idea that live music is the only thing that brings me joy and fulfillment, that I haven't really considered what else could bring me those things. It's scary to think about exploring other interests and hobbies because I'm not sure what I'll find, or if I'll be able to connect with others in the same way. But I guess what would make me feel more comfortable is if I could find something that I'm just as passionate about, something that brings me the same sense of excitement and connection. And maybe, just maybe, that something is out there waiting for me. I just need to be open to the possibility and not let my fear of the unknown hold me back.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>As you're navigating this transition, it's essential to remember that it's okay to take things at your own pace and not put too much pressure on yourself to immediately find a new passion or interest. What are some small, manageable steps you could take to start exploring these new connections and hobbies, and how might you prioritize your own comfort and well-being throughout this process?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think I've been so focused on this idea that live music is the only thing that brings me joy and fulfillment, that I haven't really considered what else could bring me those things.

                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>As you consider the possibility of letting go of your old identity and exploring new interests, what do you think would be the most empowering part of this process for you? Would it be finding a new sense of purpose or connection, or would it be the freedom to explore and discover who you are beyond your passion for live music events?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think what would be most empowering for me is the freedom to explore and discover who I am beyond my passion for live music events. It's like, I've been so defined by that aspect of myself for so long that I've forgotten that I have other interests and hobbies that could bring me joy and fulfillment too. By embracing this new aspect of myself, I'm giving myself permission to explore and discover what else I'm passionate about, and that's a really exciting and empowering feeling.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Can you help me understand how this newfound sense of freedom and exploration is influencing your emotional landscape? Are you feeling a sense of excitement and curiosity, or perhaps some uncertainty and anxiety about what the future holds? It's natural to have mixed emotions during this transition, and I'm here to support you as you navigate these feelings.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think I'm feeling a mix of emotions right now. On one hand, I'm excited to explore new interests and hobbies, and the possibility of finding new passions and connections is really exciting to me. On the other hand, I'm also feeling a sense of uncertainty and anxiety about what the future holds. I'm not sure what I'll find, or if I'll be able to connect with others in the same way. But I think the freedom to explore and discover who I am beyond my passion for live music events is really empowering for me. It's like, I'm giving myself permission to explore and discover what else I'm passionate about, and that's a really exciting and empowering feeling.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It seems like you're really embracing this sense of freedom and exploration, and I'm impressed by your willingness to consider what else might bring you joy and fulfillment. Can you tell me more about what drew you to live music events in the first place? Was it the sense of community, the thrill of the unknown, or something else entirely?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think what drew me to live music events in the first place was the sense of community and connection I felt with others who shared my passion for music. It was always a special experience, and I loved being part of a crowd that was united by our love of music. But now that I'm thinking about exploring other interests and hobbies, I realize that I've been so focused on this one aspect of myself that I haven't really considered what else could bring me that same sense of connection and community. It's like, I've been so attached to this one thing that I haven't given myself permission to explore and discover what else I'm passionate about.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>As you're exploring these new passions and connections, it's also important to acknowledge that it's okay to not find the exact same sense of community and connection right away. It might take some time to discover what truly resonates with you, and that's a normal part of the process. What are some things that you're looking forward to learning more about or trying out in the coming weeks or months?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I'm glad that I've been able to explore my feelings and thoughts about live music events and my identity. I think it's been really helpful to realize that I don't have to define myself solely by my passion for live music. I'm excited to start exploring other interests and hobbies and seeing what else brings me joy and fulfillment. I'm a little nervous about trying new things, but I'm also excited to discover new passions and connections.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're acknowledging the possibility of finding new passions and connections beyond live music events, and that's a really exciting place to be. Can you help me understand what specifically is driving your desire to explore these new interests, is it a sense of curiosity, a desire for change, or something else entirely?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think it's a combination of things. I'm feeling a sense of curiosity about what else is out there for me, and I'm also feeling a desire for change. I've been stuck in this rut for a while, and I'm ready to shake things up and see what else I'm capable of. But I'm also scared, because I don't know what I'll find, or if I'll be able to connect with others in the same way. It's like, I'm taking a leap of faith and trusting that I'll find something that brings me joy and fulfillment.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>As you consider the possibility of finding new passions and connections beyond live music events, I want to acknowledge that it's okay to feel a mix of emotions about this. It's natural to feel a sense of loss or grief around leaving behind something that's been a significant part of your identity, but it's also exciting to consider the possibility of discovering new aspects of yourself and finding new ways to connect with others.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think what's been holding me back from exploring other interests is the fear of losing that sense of community and connection that I've had with others through live music events.

But now that I'm thinking about it, I realize that I don't have to define myself solely by my passion for live music. I can find other ways to connect with others and find joy and fulfillment.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>As you continue to explore new interests and hobbies, it's natural to wonder how this shift might impact your relationships with others who are still deeply connected to live music. It's almost as if you're standing at the intersection of two different worlds, with a sense of disconnection on one side and curiosity on the other. Can you help me understand what's holding you back from fully embracing this new chapter, and what specific steps you're taking to nurture your connections with others while still staying true to yourself?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think I've been so focused on my fear of losing that sense of community and connection that I haven't given myself permission to explore and discover what else I'm passionate about.

Can you help me understand what specific fears or concerns you're having about this transition, and how you think you might be able to address them? By acknowledging and working through these concerns, you might find that you're better equipped to navigate this transition and discover new sources of joy and fulfillment.</div>
