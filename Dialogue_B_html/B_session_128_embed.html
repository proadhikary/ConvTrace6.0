                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Leroy, it's nice to meet you. Could you tell me a bit about what brings you here today?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Iâ€™ve been feeling really inadequate lately. It feels like no matter how hard I work, I'll never be able to afford the lifestyle I want. I see people around me living lavishly, and it just makes me feel worse.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Can you help me understand what you think would need to change in your life for you to feel like you're measuring up to your own expectations? What specific steps or changes would you need to make to feel more confident and self-assured?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Honestly, I'm not sure. I think I just need to make more money, but even when I do, it never seems to be enough. Maybe if I could afford a nicer car or a bigger house, I'd feel better about myself. But even then, I'd probably just compare myself to someone else who has something better. I don't know, maybe I'm just destined to feel this way.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It's interesting that you mention being a snakeskin oil salesman, I'm wondering if there's a sense of identity tied to that work, and if feeling like you're not making enough money is also a reflection of not being good enough as a person.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah, I guess I do identify with being a successful snakeskin oil salesman. It's a family business, and I feel like I'm continuing a legacy. But sometimes I wonder if I'm just doing it because it's what's expected of me, rather than because I truly enjoy it.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like the pressure to live up to your family's legacy and expectations has created a sense of identity foreclosure, where your sense of self-worth is deeply tied to your work as a snakeskin oil salesman. This can be a heavy burden to carry, and it's no wonder you're feeling overwhelmed and uncertain about your future. Can you help me understand what this sense of identity foreclosure looks like in your daily life, and how it affects your relationships and overall well-being?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>That's a good point. I think a lot of my self-worth is tied to my work, and when I'm not making enough money, I feel like I'm not good enough as a person. It's like I'm living up to others' expectations rather than my own.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It's interesting to note how your sense of identity is deeply tied to your work as a snakeskin oil salesman, and how this might be influencing your self-worth. Many people struggle with this identity-based self, where their sense of self-worth is heavily dependent on their performance and achievements in their work.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah, I can see how that would be a heavy burden to carry. It's like I'm constantly living up to others' expectations and not my own. I feel like I'm trying to prove something to others, rather than being true to myself.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're carrying a lot of weight on your shoulders, trying to meet others' expectations and live up to your family's legacy. It's no wonder you're feeling overwhelmed and uncertain about your future. Research has shown that when we tie our self-worth to our work, it can actually lead to a phenomenon called activation syndrome, which can trigger a sense of panic and self-doubt with even small setbacks or failures. Can you help me understand what it would mean for you to separate your identity as a person from your identity as a snakeskin oil salesman, and what small steps you could take to start exploring what brings you joy and fulfillment beyond your career?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think I see what you mean now. It's like I'm trying to be this perfect version of myself, both in my work and in my personal life, and it's exhausting. I feel like I'm constantly trying to prove something to others, rather than being true to myself. It's like I'm living in this illusion that if I just make more money or achieve more success, I'll be happy and fulfilled. But deep down, I know that's not true.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It's interesting to me that you mention feeling like you need to be a certain way to be loved and accepted, because it sounds like that's a common theme in many people's lives. Research has shown that this pressure to conform to societal expectations can have a significant impact on our mental health and well-being. Can you help me understand what you think you would gain or lose by letting go of this need to be perfect and embracing your true self, imperfections and all?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>That's a really good point. It's like I'm trying to be this perfect version of myself, both in my work and in my personal life, and it's exhausting. I feel like I'm constantly trying to prove something to others, rather than being true to myself. It's like I'm living in this illusion that if I just make more money or achieve more success, I'll be happy and fulfilled. But deep down, I know that's not true.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>As you've been sharing your struggles with me, I've noticed that you often seem to be judging yourself harshly, holding yourself to an unrealistic standard of perfection. It's like you're constantly asking yourself, Am I good enough? and Am I living up to expectations? This is a common pattern in many people's lives, and it's not necessarily a reflection of your abilities or worth as a person. Would you be willing to explore with me how this self-criticism is affecting your daily life and relationships, and what might happen if you were to practice some self-compassion and acknowledge your imperfections?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think I've been so caught up in trying to be perfect that I've forgotten what it's like to be a normal person. I feel like I'm constantly striving for something that's unattainable, and it's exhausting.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It's no wonder you're feeling overwhelmed and exhausted, given the immense pressure you've been putting on yourself to be perfect in all areas of your life. Research suggests that perfectionism can have a significant impact on our mental health, leading to increased stress, anxiety, and depression. It sounds like you're not only struggling with the demands of perfectionism, but also with the fear of not being good enough. How do you think this pressure to be perfect has affected your sense of self-worth and overall well-being?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think I've been so focused on trying to be perfect that I've lost sight of what truly makes me happy. I've been trying to fit into this mold of what I think others expect of me, rather than being true to myself. It's like I'm living in this illusion that if I just achieve more success, I'll be happy and fulfilled. But deep down, I know that's not true.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It's as if you've been carrying this heavy load of self-criticism and perfectionism for so long that you've almost forgotten what it's like to be kind to yourself and allow yourself to make mistakes. Research suggests that perfectionism can actually be a self-sabotaging behavior, as it can lead to increased stress and anxiety.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think I'm starting to see a pattern in my thoughts and feelings, and it's helping me understand why I've been stuck in this cycle of inadequacy for so long. I realize now that my sense of self-worth is deeply tied to my work as a snakeskin oil salesman, and that's creating a heavy burden for me. I feel like I'm constantly trying to prove something to others, rather than being true to myself.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It's interesting to note how this pattern of disconnection from your true self has been playing out in your relationships and work, and how it may be impacting your sense of self-worth. It's also important to acknowledge that this is a common experience many people face, and that it's not necessarily a reflection of your worth or abilities as a person. By recognizing this pattern and its effects, we can start to explore ways to cultivate a more authentic and compassionate relationship with yourself, and develop strategies to help you stay grounded and focused on what's truly important to you in the midst of pressure and expectation.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think I'm starting to see how my need for perfection and my identity as a successful snakeskin oil salesman are intertwined, and how that's been driving my feelings of inadequacy. It's like I've been living in this illusion that if I just achieve more success, I'll be happy and fulfilled, but deep down, I know that's not true. I'm starting to realize that my sense of self-worth is not tied to my work, but to who I am as a person, and that's a scary thought. I'm not sure how to reconcile these two identities, but I'm willing to explore and figure it out.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're already taking a significant step by recognizing the illusion of perfection and the pressure to live up to others' expectations. Can you tell me more about what you think it would mean to start embracing your true self, imperfections and all, and how that might look in your daily life?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think it would mean letting go of this need to be perfect and embracing my true self, even if that means making mistakes or not achieving some arbitrary standard of success. It's scary to think about because it means I'd have to redefine what success means to me and what's truly important in my life.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>As you begin to let go of the need for perfection, it's natural to feel a mix of emotions, including uncertainty and even excitement. It's as if you're peeling away the layers of conditioning and societal expectations, allowing yourself to rediscover who you are underneath. Can you tell me more about what you hope to gain from this process of self-discovery and embracing your true self?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think I'm starting to see a pattern in my thoughts and feelings, and it's helping me understand why I've been stuck in this cycle of inadequacy for so long.

                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It's not uncommon for us to tie our sense of identity and self-worth to our work, especially when it's an important part of who we are. And it sounds like you're starting to realize that this has led to a lot of stress and anxiety in your life. Can you help me understand what you think would happen if you were to take a step back and re-evaluate what's truly important to you, beyond your role as a snakeskin oil salesman? What aspects of yourself and your life would you like to rediscover or prioritize in this process?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think I'm starting to understand that my sense of self-worth is not tied to my work as a snakeskin oil salesman, but to who I am as a person. This realization is both liberating and terrifying. I'm not sure how to reconcile these two identities, but I'm willing to explore and figure it out.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Noticing how much societal pressure and family expectations can weigh heavily on our sense of identity and self-worth, it's no wonder you're feeling uncertain about your future. Could you help me understand what it would mean for you to reframe your understanding of success and importance in your life, moving away from the snakeskin oil salesman role and towards a more authentic sense of self?</div>

                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like this need for perfection has been a long-standing pattern for you, and it's understandable that it's been challenging to break free from it. It's also clear that you're feeling the weight of this pressure in many areas of your life. I'd like to share with you that many people struggle with perfectionism, and it's not uncommon for it to be linked to underlying feelings of inadequacy or a fear of not meeting expectations.</div>

                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It's not uncommon for individuals to tie their sense of identity and self-worth to a specific role or profession, and it sounds like you've been carrying this burden for a while. Can you tell me more about what you think would happen if you were to separate your sense of self from your work as a snakeskin oil salesman? How do you think that would impact your daily life and relationships, and what do you think you might gain from creating a sense of distinction between your professional and personal identities?</div>

                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>As you continue to explore this sense of snakeskin oil salesman, I want to acknowledge that it's not uncommon for people to tie their sense of identity to their work, especially in a culture that emphasizes achievement and success. This doesn't mean it's healthy or sustainable, but it's a common pattern. Can you help me understand what you think it would mean to start untangling this knot and exploring what makes you unique and valuable beyond your work?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think I'm starting to see that my sense of identity and self-worth are deeply intertwined with my work as a snakeskin oil salesman.

It's no wonder you're feeling exhausted and uncertain about your future. It sounds like you've been living someone else's dream, rather than your own. What do you think would happen if you were to take a step back and re-evaluate what truly brings you joy and fulfillment?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>It's interesting to me that you keep bringing up the idea of snakeskin oil salesman as a symbol of my identity. I think that's because I've been so defined by that role for so long. I've been trying to live up to the expectations of others, rather than being true to myself. It's like I've been carrying this heavy burden for so long, and it's exhausting. I'm starting to realize that my sense of self-worth is not tied to my work, but to who I am as a person.

                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're recognizing the weight of societal expectations and the pressure to conform to certain standards, and that's a crucial step in breaking free from the constraints of your professional identity. Can you tell me more about what you think it would mean for you to defy those expectations and create a new narrative for yourself, one that's not defined solely by your work as a snakeskin oil salesman?</div>

                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>As you explore the roots of your feelings of inadequacy and the impact it has on your daily life, I want to acknowledge that it takes a lot of courage to confront these emotions head-on. It's understandable that you've been putting a lot of pressure on yourself to be perfect, especially given the high stakes of your work as a snakeskin oil salesman. But I want to gently challenge you to consider that your worth and identity are not solely defined by your profession. What if you were to let go of the need to be perfect and instead focus on cultivating a sense of purpose and fulfillment that comes from within?</div>
