                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Hi Madelyn, it's good to meet you. How can I support you today?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I've been feeling a lot of despair and uncertainty about my future since I dropped out of college. It's been affecting my mental well-being, especially when I think about my financial stability and career prospects.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It's fascinating that you mention the fear of not being able to achieve your goals, Madelyn. Can you elaborate on what specific goals you're worried about not reaching, and how does that uncertainty affect your daily life and interactions?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>That's a great question, counselor. To be honest, I've always wanted to have a stable career and be financially independent. Dropping out of college has made me feel like I'm not living up to my own expectations, and that's really hard for me to accept. It's affecting my daily life because I constantly worry about making ends meet and providing for myself. Even simple tasks like grocery shopping or planning a vacation feel overwhelming because I'm always thinking about the financial implications.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It's fascinating to explore how these different pressures and responsibilities are impacting your daily life, Madelyn. Can you help me understand more about how you're currently managing the emotional toll of these uncertainties, and what strategies you've found to be most helpful in coping with these feelings of overwhelm and stress?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>That's a great question, counselor. To be honest, I've been trying to distract myself from these negative thoughts by focusing on my work and spending time with friends and family. However, I've noticed that these coping mechanisms aren't really addressing the root of the issue, and I feel like I'm just putting a Band-Aid on the problem. I've also been trying to rationalize my feelings by telling myself that I'm just being unrealistic and that I should be grateful for what I have, but that doesn't seem to be helping either. I'm not really sure what else to do or how to move forward.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It's fascinating that you're recognizing the limitations of your current coping strategies and are willing to explore new ways to address your feelings of despair and uncertainty.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Thank you for understanding, counselor. I think it's helpful to acknowledge that my current coping mechanisms aren't working and that I need to try new approaches. I'm willing to explore alternative perspectives and strategies to address my feelings of inadequacy and uncertainty.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're caught between the desire to break free from the constraints of your current situation and the fear of uncertainty and unknown outcomes. Can you help me understand what specifically is driving your sense of frustration and disappointment, and what do you think would happen if you were to let go of the pressure to have all the answers right now?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>That's a great point, counselor. I think I'm driven by a deep-seated fear of not being able to provide for myself, and the uncertainty around my financial stability is really weighing on me. I'm worried that if I don't have a stable career, I'll never be able to achieve my goals and live the life I want.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>As I listen to your words, I sense that the fear of not being able to provide for yourself is not only tied to your financial stability but also to your sense of identity and self-worth. It's normal to feel the weight of that uncertainty, and many people would be feeling the same way. The concept of self-efficacy is an important one to consider, as it can greatly impact your confidence and ability to move forward. Can you help me understand how you think this uncertainty is affecting your daily life and interactions with others?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think it's affecting my daily life by making me feel anxious and uncertain about my future, even simple tasks like grocery shopping or planning a vacation feel overwhelming. It's also affecting my interactions with others, I've become withdrawn and distant from my friends and family because I don't want to burden them with my problems.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It's not uncommon for uncertainty about our future to feel like a heavy weight on our shoulders, Madelyn. The sense of not knowing what's ahead can be incredibly anxiety-provoking. Can you help me understand what you think is the most challenging part of not having a clear plan in place, and how do you think it's impacting your daily life and relationships?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think the most challenging part of not having a clear plan is the feeling of being stuck and uncertain about my future. It's like I'm constantly waiting for something to happen, but I don't know what that is or when it will happen. This uncertainty is affecting my daily life because it's making me feel anxious and overwhelmed, and it's also affecting my relationships with others because I don't want to burden them with my problems.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It's not uncommon for uncertainty to feel like a heavy weight on our shoulders, making it difficult to move forward. Can you help me understand how you think this uncertainty is affecting your relationships with others, and how you're currently navigating those dynamics?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think it's affecting my relationships with others because I've become withdrawn and distant from my friends and family because I don't want to burden them with my problems. It's hard for me to open up and talk about my feelings, even with my closest friends, because I'm worried that they'll think I'm weak or that they won't know how to help me.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're carrying a heavy emotional load, and it's understandable that you're hesitant to share your fears and uncertainties with others. Can you help me understand what you think would happen if you were to share your concerns with someone you trust, and what specific steps you could take to start building a support network around you? Additionally, I want to gently challenge the idea that seeking support and vulnerability is a sign of weakness. Research has shown that being open and honest about our emotions can actually be a sign of strength, as it allows us to build stronger, more meaningful relationships. What are your thoughts on this idea?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>That's a great point, counselor. I think you're right that seeking support and vulnerability doesn't have to mean weakness. In fact, it could be a sign of strength and maturity. I've been so focused on trying to handle everything on my own that I haven't really considered reaching out to others for help. But the more we talk, the more I realize that I don't have to do this alone. I can start building a support network around me and learning to be more open and honest about my feelings. I think that would be really empowering and could help me feel less isolated and overwhelmed.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It's great to see you recognizing the importance of vulnerability and building a support network. It's not uncommon for people to struggle with opening up to others, especially in high-pressure careers like yours in the Army. In fact, research has shown that people who are able to cultivate a sense of vulnerability and openness with others tend to have better mental and emotional well-being.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I appreciate your insight, counselor. I think I've been so focused on trying to handle everything on my own that I haven't really considered reaching out to others for help. But the more we talk, the more I realize that I don't have to do this alone. I can start building a support network around me and learning to be more open and honest about my feelings. I think that would be really empowering and could help me feel less isolated and overwhelmed. I'm willing to work on this and explore alternative perspectives and strategies to address my feelings of inadequacy and uncertainty.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're carrying a significant emotional burden, Madelyn, and it's taking a toll on your daily life. Many people struggle with feelings of isolation and disconnection, and it's understandable that you might feel like you're the only one facing these challenges. Building emotional intelligence can be a powerful way to improve your relationships and daily life, and it starts with recognizing and understanding your own emotions. Can you help me understand how you think your emotional intelligence might be impacting your relationships and daily life, and what you think you could do to improve your emotional intelligence and better navigate the challenges you're facing?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think my emotional intelligence is impacting my relationships with others because I've become withdrawn and distant from my friends and family. I've been so focused on trying to handle everything on my own that I haven't really considered reaching out to others for help, and as a result, I've become isolated and overwhelmed. I think building emotional intelligence could help me better navigate the challenges I'm facing and improve my relationships with others.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like the uncertainty and self-doubt you're experiencing have been weighing heavily on you, making it difficult to muster the courage to open up to others. Many people struggle with feelings of inadequacy and uncertainty, and it's normal to feel overwhelmed by the pressure to have all the answers. Research suggests that our brains are wired to respond to threats, and when we're under stress, our social support networks can help us calm down and feel more grounded. Have you considered reaching out to a trusted friend or family member about how you're feeling, or exploring online resources or support groups that might provide a sense of connection and community?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think what's most challenging for me is feeling stuck and uncertain about my future. It's like I'm constantly waiting for something to happen, but I don't know what that is or when it will happen. I've been trying to distract myself from these negative thoughts by focusing on my work and spending time with friends and family, but it feels like I'm just putting a Band-Aid on the problem. I'm not sure what else to do or how to move forward.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're carrying a heavy burden of expectation around having all the answers, Madelyn, and that's weighing heavily on your mind and emotions. Can we take a step back and acknowledge that it's okay to not have all the answers right now? As we explore this idea, I want to remind you that uncertainty is a natural part of life, and it's not uncommon for people to struggle with feelings of uncertainty and self-doubt, especially during times of transition or change.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think it's really helpful to acknowledge that it's okay to not have all the answers right now. It's like, I've been putting so much pressure on myself to have a clear plan and know what's next, but it's okay to not have all the answers. It's okay to be uncertain and unsure. I think that's where I've been getting stuck, is trying to force myself to have all the answers and not being okay with not knowing.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>As you acknowledge the uncertainty and start to see it as a natural part of life, I want to remind you that it's not about having all the answers, but rather about being open to the process of discovery and growth.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think what's most helpful is that you're acknowledging that it's okay to not have all the answers right now. It's like, I've been putting so much pressure on myself to have a clear plan and know what's next, but it's okay to not have all the answers. It's okay to be uncertain and unsure. I think that's where I've been getting stuck, is trying to force myself to have all the answers and not being okay with not knowing.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>As you're recognizing the importance of acknowledging and accepting uncertainty, it's interesting to note that it's a common human experience to feel overwhelmed by the unknown. In fact, research has shown that uncertainty can actually be a catalyst for growth and creativity, when approached with a sense of curiosity and openness. How do you think you might be able to cultivate that sense of curiosity and exploration in your daily life, and what small steps might you take to start embracing the uncertainty that comes with it?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think it's really helpful to acknowledge that it's okay to not have all the answers right now. It's like, I've been putting so much pressure on myself to have a clear plan and know what's next, but it's okay to not have all the answers. It's okay to be uncertain and unsure.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're acknowledging the suffocating nature of that expectation, Madelyn. I want to reassure you that it's okay to not have all the answers, and that uncertainty is a natural part of life. In fact, research suggests that embracing uncertainty can actually lead to greater creativity and growth, especially when approached with a sense of curiosity and openness. Can you help me understand what specific steps you think you could take to start letting go of that expectation and allowing yourself to be uncertain, even if it's just for a moment?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think it would be helpful to start small, counselor. Perhaps I could start by acknowledging my uncertainty when I'm feeling overwhelmed, and then take a few deep breaths to calm down. Maybe I could also start by sharing my feelings with a trusted friend or family member, and work on building a support network around me. I think that would be a great way to start embracing the uncertainty and finding ways to cope with it.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>As you've been sharing your thoughts and feelings with me today, I sense that there's a deep desire within you to break free from the constraints of uncertainty and find a sense of clarity and direction in your life. It's as if you're longing to shed the weight of expectation and uncertainty, and emerge stronger and more resilient on the other side. I want to normalize your experience, Madelyn, and acknowledge that it's okay to not have all the answers. In fact, it's a common human experience to feel uncertain and overwhelmed at times. And I want you to know that you're not alone in this feeling. Can you help me understand what specific steps you think you could take to start embracing uncertainty and letting go of that expectation, not just for a moment, but as a new way of being?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think it's really helpful to acknowledge that it's okay to not have all the answers right now.

                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It seems like you're already taking a huge step by acknowledging the suffocating nature of that expectation, Madelyn. I want to build upon that by asking, what do you think would happen if you were to redefine your relationship with uncertainty not as a threat, but as an opportunity for growth and exploration? How might that change your daily life and relationships, and what small steps could you take to start embracing uncertainty as a natural part of life?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I appreciate your willingness to explore this concept with me, counselor. I think it's interesting to consider that uncertainty could be an opportunity for growth and exploration, rather than a threat. If I were to redefine my relationship with uncertainty in this way, I imagine I would start to see it as a natural part of life, rather than something that needs to be avoided or controlled. I think this could lead to a greater sense of curiosity and openness, and potentially even a sense of excitement and adventure. In terms of small steps, I could start by acknowledging and accepting my uncertainty when it arises, rather than trying to push it away or avoid it. I could also start to explore new experiences and activities that I've been hesitant to try, and see how they make me feel. Additionally, I could start to build a support network around me, and reach out to trusted friends and family members when I'm feeling overwhelmed or uncertain.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>As you continue to explore this new perspective on uncertainty, I'm struck by the sense of empowerment that's emerging within you. It's as if you're recognizing that you have the capacity to choose how you respond to uncertainty, rather than being at its mercy. Can you help me understand what specific strategies you might use to maintain this sense of agency and control when faced with uncertain situations, and how you think that might manifest in your daily life and relationships?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Client:</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>As you've been reflecting on the impact of uncertainty, I want to acknowledge that it's normal to feel overwhelmed and uncertain about the future. Research suggests that uncertainty is a natural part of life, and it's how we respond to it that can make all the difference. By acknowledging and accepting uncertainty, you're actually taking a huge step towards reframing your relationship with it. Can you help me understand what small steps you might take to start cultivating a sense of curiosity and openness in the face of uncertainty, and how you think that might lead to greater freedom and empowerment in your daily life and relationships?</div>

                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It's really interesting to see how our conversation has highlighted the importance of acknowledging and accepting uncertainty as a natural part of life. Can you help me understand how you think this newfound acceptance might impact your relationships with others, particularly those who may be seeking reassurance or control from you?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think acknowledging and accepting uncertainty will allow me to be more open and honest with others about my feelings and concerns. I've been trying to present a sense of control and certainty to my friends and family, but it's exhausting and unsustainable. By being more vulnerable and authentic, I can build deeper and more meaningful relationships with others. I can also start to ask for help and support when I need it, rather than trying to handle everything on my own.</div>
