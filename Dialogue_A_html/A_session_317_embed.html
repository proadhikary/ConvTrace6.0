                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Hi Wendy, it's nice to meet you. How are you feeling today?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I've been struggling with a lot of self-doubt recently, especially when it comes to building and selling computers. Even though my friends say I'm good at it, I just can't shake off the feeling that I'm not good enough.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>I sense that you're carrying a lot of emotional weight with you when it comes to your skills and abilities, especially when it comes to something you're passionate about like building and selling computers. Can you tell me more about what triggers this self-doubt? Is there a specific incident or experience that stood out to you?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>It's like, whenever I'm building a computer, I'm constantly thinking about all the things that could go wrong. What if I forget a crucial part? What if the CPU isn't compatible with the motherboard? It's like, I know I've done it before, but I just can't shake off the feeling that I'm going to mess it up. And then, when I'm done, I start thinking about how others might perceive my work. Are they going to think it's good enough? Am I just pretending to be good at this?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're experiencing a lot of anxiety and self-doubt when it comes to building and selling computers, and it's affecting your confidence in your abilities. It's interesting that you mention thinking about what others might perceive your work, that gives me the sense that you're also concerned about external validation. Can you tell me more about what you mean by pretending to be good at this? What does that feel like for you?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah, it's like, I'm always worried about being found out as a fake or a pretender. Like, what if someone asks me a question about computer building and I don't know the answer? What if they see me struggling to fix something and they think I'm not as good as I thought I was? It's like, I'm constantly living in fear of being exposed as a fraud or a charlatan.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like this sense of pretending to be good at something is closely tied to a fear of being exposed or found out as not being good enough. Can you tell me more about what you think would happen if you were found out as not being good enough? What would that look like for you, and how would that affect your sense of self-worth?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah, it's like, I think if I was found out, I would feel like I've been living a lie and that all the positive feedback I've received is just a bunch of lies too. I would feel like I'm not good enough and that I'm just pretending to be something I'm not. And that would just crush me, it would make me feel like I'm worthless and that I have no value.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like the fear of being found out as not being good enough is deeply tied to your sense of self-worth and identity. It's as if you're carrying a heavy burden of responsibility to be perfect or excellent in this area of your life. Can you explore with me what you think would happen if you allowed yourself to make mistakes or not be perfect in building and selling computers? What would that look like for you, and how would that affect your relationship with yourself and others?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah, it's like, I think if I let myself make mistakes or not be perfect, I would feel like I'm being selfish or lazy. I would feel like I'm not taking my abilities seriously and that I'm not respecting myself or others enough to put in the effort to be good at something. It's like, I'm constantly trying to prove myself to others and to myself that I'm capable of doing something well.</div>

                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>It's really hard for me to even think about letting go of this need for perfection, because it's become such a big part of who I am. I feel like I've been living for other people's expectations and not my own. It's scary to think about being imperfect and not having control over the outcome. But at the same time, I'm tired of feeling like I'm living someone else's dream and not my own. I want to find a way to be okay with making mistakes and not being perfect, but it's hard for me to imagine what that would even look like.</div>

                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I'm starting to realize that my need for perfection is not only affecting my self-worth, but also my relationships with others.
