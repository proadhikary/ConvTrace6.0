                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Hi Brian, it's nice to meet you. How are you feeling today?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I'm alright, a bit frustrated to be honest. I went fishing two weeks ago and didn't catch anything, and ever since then, I've been feeling really incompetent and critical of myself.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like that experience really shook your confidence. Can you tell me more about what went through your mind when you didn't catch anything? Was it the first time it's happened to you, and how did you usually feel about fishing before this?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah, it was the first time I didn't catch anything, and to be honest, it was a bit of a blow to my ego. I've always been pretty proud of my fishing skills, and not catching anything made me feel like I've lost that ability. It's like my mind is constantly replaying the moment when I didn't catch anything, and it's hard for me to shake off the feeling of incompetence.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like this experience has really stuck with you and is causing you to replay negative thoughts about yourself. Can you tell me more about what you mean by I've lost that ability? What specifically do you feel like you've lost, and how has that affected your daily life?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah, it's like I've lost my confidence in my fishing skills, and it's affecting my daily life in a way. I've been having trouble sleeping at night, and I've been feeling really anxious about going out and doing things that I normally enjoy. It's like this feeling of incompetence has taken over my mind, and I'm struggling to shake it off.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like this experience has really impacted your sense of confidence and ability to enjoy activities you normally like. It's understandable that not catching anything would be disappointing, but it's clear that it's affected you more deeply than you expected. Can you tell me more about what you think is driving this feeling of incompetence? Is it the fear of not being able to do things well, or is it something else entirely?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah, I think it's the fear of not being able to do things well. As a paramedic, I'm always trying to be prepared and competent in emergency situations, and I think this experience has made me question my ability to do that. I'm worried that if I'm not good enough at fishing, then maybe I'm not good enough at my job either. It's like this feeling of incompetence has spilled over into other areas of my life, and I'm struggling to separate the two.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like this experience has triggered some deeper fears about your competence and ability to handle emergency situations as a paramedic. It's understandable to worry about not being good enough, but it's clear that this feeling of incompetence is affecting your daily life and ability to enjoy activities you normally like. Can you tell me more about what you think would happen if you weren't good enough at your job? What would that look like, and how would that affect your sense of identity and self-worth?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah, I think it would mean that I'm not doing my job well enough, and that's a really scary thought for me. It would mean that I'm not making a difference, that I'm not helping people, and that I'm putting them in danger by not being competent enough. It's like it would be a blow to my sense of purpose and identity as a paramedic. If I'm not good enough, then what am I good for?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like the fear of not being good enough is deeply tied to your sense of purpose and identity as a paramedic. It's understandable that you're worried about not being able to do your job well enough, but it's clear that this feeling of incompetence is also affecting your daily life and ability to enjoy activities you normally like. Can you tell me more about what you think would happen if you weren't able to separate this feeling of incompetence from your job as a paramedic? Would it mean that you would have to re-evaluate your entire sense of self-worth?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah, I think it would mean that I would have to re-evaluate my entire sense of self-worth. It would be like my entire identity as a paramedic and as a person would be called into question. I would have to wonder if I'm doing anything meaningful or if I'm just going through the motions.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like the fear of not being good enough is deeply tied to your sense of purpose and identity as a paramedic, and that this feeling of incompetence is threatening to undermine your entire sense of self-worth. It's understandable that you're worried about not being able to do your job well enough, but it's clear that this feeling is also affecting your daily life and ability to enjoy activities you normally like. Can you tell me more about what you think would happen if you were able to separate this feeling of incompetence from your job as a paramedic? Would that mean that you would be able to regain your confidence and sense of purpose, or would there still be residual effects?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah, I think if I were able to separate this feeling of incompetence from my job as a paramedic, it would mean that I would be able to regain my confidence and sense of purpose. I would be able to acknowledge that it's just one experience and not define my entire identity as a paramedic.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like this experience has really shaken your confidence and sense of purpose as a paramedic, and it's affecting your daily life in a significant way. It's understandable that you're worried about not being good enough, but it's clear that this feeling of incompetence is also affecting your ability to enjoy activities you normally like. I'd like to explore this further with you - can you tell me more about what you mean by I would have to re-evaluate my entire sense of self-worth? What specifically would that look like for you, and how do you think that would impact your daily life and relationships?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think it would mean that I would have to start questioning everything I do as a paramedic, and whether I'm truly making a difference. It would be like my entire sense of purpose and identity as a paramedic would be called into question. I would have to wonder if I'm just going through the motions, and if I'm truly making a positive impact on people's lives. That thought is really scary for me, because it would mean that I would have to re-evaluate my entire career and my sense of self-worth. It would be like I would have to start from scratch and figure out who I am and what I'm good for.</div>

                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I can see how my fear of not being good enough is closely tied to my sense of purpose and identity as a paramedic. It's like I'm defining my entire worth as a person by my ability to perform well in my job, and if I'm not good enough, then I'm not good enough as a person. That's a really scary thought for me because it means that I'm putting a lot of pressure on myself to be perfect, and I know that's not sustainable. I think it would be really helpful if I could find a way to separate my self-worth from my job performance and recognize that I'm still a valuable and important person even if I make mistakes or have a bad day.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're carrying a heavy burden of expectation and pressure to be perfect as a paramedic, and this experience has made you realize that it's not sustainable. It's understandable that you're worried about not being good enough, but it's clear that this feeling of incompetence is also affecting your daily life and ability to enjoy activities you normally like. I'd like to explore this further with you - can you tell me more about what you think would happen if you were able to let go of the need to be perfect and recognize that you're still a valuable and important person even if you make mistakes or have a bad day? How do you think that would impact your daily life and relationships?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah, I think if I were able to let go of the need to be perfect and recognize that I'm still a valuable and important person even if I make mistakes or have a bad day, it would mean that I would be able to take a step back and re-evaluate my priorities and values. I would be able to focus on what's truly important to me, like helping people and making a positive impact, rather than being defined by my job performance. It would also mean that I would be able to be kinder to myself when I make mistakes, and not beat myself up over them. I think that would be a huge relief, and it would allow me to enjoy my job and my life more fully.</div>
