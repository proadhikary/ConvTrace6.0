                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Hello, Leonard. It's nice to meet you. How are you feeling today?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I've been feeling a bit down lately because I keep thinking that my grandpa is disappointed in me. A few months ago, I made a mistake, and since then, I've been interpreting his actions as signs of my inadequacy.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Can you tell me more about this mistake you made and what you mean by signs of my inadequacy? How has this been affecting your daily life?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>That mistake was just a small slip-up, but I felt so ashamed about it that I started beating myself up over it. When my grandpa doesn't do something I expect him to do, I immediately assume it's because he's disappointed in me. It's like my mind is wired to think the worst about myself. And it's not just my grandpa; I feel like I'm a disappointment to everyone around me. It's really hard to shake off these feelings of inadequacy, and it's been affecting my mood and relationships with others.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're putting a lot of pressure on yourself and making some assumptions about others' thoughts and feelings. Can you help me understand why you think your grandpa's actions are a reflection of your worth as a person? What does his disappointment mean to you, and how did your shame around the mistake change your self-perception?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>That's a tough one, I think. I've always felt like my grandpa's approval was really important to me, and I wanted to make him proud. When I made that mistake, I felt like I let him down, and that's what's stuck with me. It's like I've become really sensitive to any slight or perceived slight from him. And I think that's because I've been putting so much pressure on myself to be perfect, to be the good grandson that I feel like I'm constantly falling short. But I don't know, maybe that's just me being silly, and I should just focus on being a good person instead of trying to be perfect.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like your grandpa's approval has been a significant source of validation for you, and when you made the mistake, it felt like you lost that validation. You're not alone in putting pressure on yourself to be perfect, but it's interesting that you mention being a good grandson specifically. Can you explore what that means to you? What does it look like to be a good grandson in your mind, and how does that compare to being a good person?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think being a good grandson means pleasing my grandpa and doing things that make him happy. It's like I'm trying to earn his approval and love by being perfect. But when I'm not perfect, I feel like I'm not good enough, and that's when the shame and guilt kick in. Being a good person, on the other hand, feels more like... I don't know, being genuine and authentic. It's like, even if I make mistakes, I can still be a good person because I'm trying my best. But being a good grandson feels like a specific set of expectations that I need to meet, and it's hard to shake off the feeling that I'm not meeting those expectations.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like being a good grandson is closely tied to your sense of self-worth and is influenced by your desire to please your grandpa and earn his approval. You're presenting it as a more rigid and expectation-based standard, whereas being a good person feels more like a quality that can be demonstrated in various ways. Can you tell me more about what you mean by being genuine and authentic when you're being a good person? What does that look like in your daily life, and how do you think that might differ from being a good grandson?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>That's a great point, and I think I can see how I've been putting a lot of pressure on myself to meet those expectations. Being genuine and authentic feels like I'm being true to myself and not trying to please anyone else. For example, when I'm playing with my cat, Mater, I'm just enjoying the moment and not thinking about how my grandpa might react. It's like, I'm not trying to be perfect; I'm just being me. I think that's what being a good person looks like to me.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like being genuine and authentic is about being present in the moment and not worrying about what others think. You're using the example of playing with your cat as a way to demonstrate what that looks like. Can you think of other times when you've felt like you've been being a good person, rather than trying to meet the expectations of being a good grandson? How do you think your grandpa might react if you were to be more authentic and genuine in your interactions with him, rather than trying to please him all the time?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think being more authentic and genuine with my grandpa would be really scary at first, but also kind of freeing. If I were to be myself and not try to meet his expectations, I might not get the reaction I'm expecting, and that's okay. I guess I've been so focused on pleasing him that I've forgotten what it's like to just be myself around him.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you've been carrying around a lot of pressure to be perfect and please your grandpa, which has led to feelings of shame and inadequacy. You're starting to uncover what it means to be a good person, which is more about being genuine and authentic. Can you imagine having a conversation with your grandpa where you're being yourself, without trying to meet his expectations? What do you think might happen in that conversation, and what are your fears about being more authentic with him?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I can imagine having that conversation with my grandpa, and it's scary to think about, but it's also exciting. I think he would be surprised if I just showed up as myself, without trying to be perfect or please him all the time. He might even be proud of me for being brave enough to be authentic. My fear is that he might not understand me or that he might think I'm being rebellious or disobedient. But at the same time, I think it could be a really liberating experience for both of us.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're carrying around a lot of expectations and pressure to please your grandpa, which is affecting your mood and relationships.

                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think it's really interesting how I've been putting so much pressure on myself to be perfect, and how that's affected my relationships with others. I never realized how much I was trying to please my grandpa, and how that was tied to my sense of self-worth. Being more authentic and genuine with him is scary, but it's also kind of freeing. I'm excited to explore what that might look like in our conversations and how it might affect our relationship.</div>
