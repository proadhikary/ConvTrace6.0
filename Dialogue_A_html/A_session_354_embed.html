                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Hi David, welcome to our session today. How are you feeling about starting this process?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Hi, thank you. I'm feeling a bit nervous but also hopeful. I really want to address these feelings that have been bothering me.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>That's completely understandable, David. It takes a lot of courage to acknowledge and seek help for our struggles. Can you tell me a bit more about what's been bothering you and what you're hoping to work on during our time together?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I've been struggling with feelings of inadequacy and low self-esteem, especially when it comes to gaming. I feel like I'm not good enough and that I'll never be able to progress or achieve my goals. It's like I'm stuck in this cycle of self-doubt and negative thoughts, and it's affecting my overall mood and self-perception. I want to learn how to break free from this pattern and develop a more positive and confident mindset.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Can you help me understand what you mean by 'not good enough' and what specific thoughts or situations trigger these feelings of inadequacy in your gaming life? For example, is it when you're playing with others, trying to complete a particular level or achievement, or something else entirely?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think what triggers these feelings is when I feel like I'm not progressing as quickly as others or when I make mistakes during a game. I start to think things like, I'm so bad at this, or I'll never be able to beat this level. It's like my mind is constantly replaying these negative thoughts, and it's hard for me to shake them off.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Can you tell me more about what's going on when you're thinking these thoughts? Are you replaying specific moments or situations in your head, or is it more of a general feeling of being overwhelmed by self-doubt? And how do you usually try to distract yourself or cope with these feelings when they come up?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Those thoughts can be really overwhelming, and I often try to distract myself by playing other games or watching videos online. Sometimes I'll also talk to my friend about how I'm feeling, but I haven't shared my deepest concerns with them because I'm afraid they might think I'm being irrational or weak.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like these negative thoughts can be really pervasive and hard to shake off, and you've developed some coping mechanisms to try and deal with them. It's understandable that you might be hesitant to share your concerns with others, especially if you're worried about being judged or not taken seriously. Can you tell me more about what it's like for you to feel like you're keeping these feelings inside, and how that affects your sense of self and relationships with others?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I feel like I'm carrying this heavy weight of negative thoughts and emotions inside me, and it's exhausting. It's like I'm constantly fighting a battle in my own mind, trying to silence the voices of self-doubt and criticism. It's isolating to feel like I'm the only one struggling with this, and it's hard for me to connect with others when I'm feeling so uncertain and insecure about myself.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like carrying around these negative thoughts and feelings of inadequacy is taking a toll on your emotional well-being and relationships. It's like you're shouldering a heavy burden, and it's affecting your sense of self and ability to connect with others. Can you tell me more about what you think would happen if you were to share these feelings with others? What are your fears about being judged or not taken seriously, and how do you think that might impact your relationships?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>That's a really good question. I think if I were to share these feelings with others, I would be worried that they would think I'm weak or that I'm just being overly sensitive. I'm afraid they would judge me or tell me to toughen up or stop being so negative. I'm also worried that they might not understand what I'm going through or that they might not be able to relate to my feelings.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're concerned about being judged or not taken seriously if you share your feelings with others. You're worried that people might think you're weak or overly sensitive. Can you tell me more about what you think would happen if you were to share these feelings with a trusted friend or family member, someone who genuinely cares about you and wants to support you? Would you be open to exploring that possibility, and what would it take for you to feel comfortable sharing your struggles with someone close to you?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>It's interesting that you bring up the idea of sharing my feelings with someone close to me. I think if I were to share my struggles with a trusted friend or family member, I would need to feel like they're genuinely interested in listening and understanding me, without judgment or trying to offer solutions. I would need to feel like they're willing to listen to me without interrupting or dismissing my feelings. Maybe we could even role-play a situation where I share my concerns with them and see how they respond. That way, I could get a sense of how they would react and whether it would be a supportive and non-judgmental conversation.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>That's a really great idea, David. Role-playing can be a powerful way to practice sharing our struggles with others and get a sense of how they might respond. It can also help us build confidence in our ability to express ourselves and assert our needs. Would you be open to exploring this further in our sessions, and maybe even having a few role-plays to help you build confidence in sharing your concerns with others?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think that would be really helpful, actually. I've been feeling like I'm stuck in this pattern of negative thoughts and self-doubt, and I'm not sure how to break free from it. The idea of role-playing with you or another trusted person could help me feel more comfortable sharing my struggles with others and get a sense of how they might respond. I'm hoping that by exploring this, I can develop more confidence in my ability to express myself and assert my needs, and maybe even start to shift the way I think about myself and my abilities.</div>

                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like these feelings of inadequacy and self-doubt are deeply tied to your experience of playing video games, and that the fear of not meeting others' expectations is a significant driver of these feelings. Can you help me understand what you think others might be expecting of you in terms of your gaming abilities? Is it that they want you to be better than you are, or that you should be able to master a game without effort? And how do you think these expectations might be impacting your sense of self-worth?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think that others might be expecting me to be better at gaming than I am, and that I should be able to master a game without effort. I feel like I'm constantly being compared to others, and that I'm always falling short. It's like I'm living up to a certain standard that I don't feel I can meet, and that's really frustrating.</div>

                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think what I'm trying to say is that these feelings of inadequacy and self-doubt are so deeply ingrained in me that it's hard for me to see a way out of this pattern. I feel like I'm stuck in this cycle of negative thoughts and self-doubt, and I don't know how to break free from it. I'm hoping that by exploring these feelings with you, I can start to understand them better and figure out ways to overcome them.</div>

                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think it's really interesting that you asked me to consider what would happen if I were to let go of these expectations and focus on my own progress and enjoyment of the game. It's like, I've been so focused on trying to meet others' expectations that I've forgotten what it's like to just enjoy playing for the sake of playing. Maybe if I could let go of this need to be better than everyone else, I could start to focus on my own growth and development, and that would be a more positive and empowering experience for me.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're carrying around a lot of negative self-talk and self-doubt, and that it's really affecting your sense of self-worth and ability to connect with others.

                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think what I'm trying to say is that I'm still struggling to understand why I feel like I'm not good enough, and why these negative thoughts keep coming back. It's like, I'll have a good gaming session, and then suddenly I'll start thinking about all the mistakes I made and how I'm not as good as others. It's like my mind is constantly replaying these negative thoughts, and it's hard for me to shake them off.
