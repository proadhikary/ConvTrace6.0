                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Hi Brooke, I'm glad you could join me today. How are you feeling right now?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I'm feeling a bit nervous but also hopeful. I really want to work on these feelings of inadequacy I have because of my job.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Can you tell me more about what's been going on at your job that's been making you feel inadequate? What specific situations or interactions have been contributing to these feelings?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think it's just the constant feeling of being judged by others, especially when I'm serving customers who seem more successful or have higher social status. Sometimes I feel like they're looking down on me just because I'm a waiter, and it makes me feel like I'm not good enough.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're feeling like you're being evaluated and judged a lot, which can be really uncomfortable. Can you tell me more about what that's like for you? What's the worst part of feeling like you're being judged, and how has that been impacting your daily life and interactions with customers?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yes, it's like a constant stress in the back of my mind, feeling like everyone is looking at me and judging me. Even when I'm just doing my job, I feel like I'm being scrutinized and that people are thinking I'm not good enough. It's hard to shake off that feeling, and it makes me really anxious and unsure of myself. When I'm interacting with customers, I feel like I'm walking on eggshells, trying not to make any mistakes, because I'm so worried about what they think of me. It's affecting my self-esteem and overall well-being, and I just want to find a way to overcome these feelings and feel more confident in my abilities.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like the feeling of being judged and evaluated is really pervasive and affecting many areas of your life. Can you tell me more about what you think is driving this need for validation from others? Is there a particular time in your life when you first started feeling this way, or is it something that's always been present for you?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>That's a great question. I think it started when I was in high school and I didn't have a clear direction for my future. My mom was a nurse and I always thought I would follow in her footsteps, but I ended up not being interested in pursuing a career in healthcare. I felt like I was disappointing her and myself, and that's when I started to feel like I wasn't good enough. As I got older, I tried to prove myself in different ways, like getting a job and being successful, but the feeling of inadequacy has always been there, especially when I'm interacting with people who seem more successful or have higher social status.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like this feeling of inadequacy has been with you for a while, and it's been fueled by a sense of not meeting others' expectations, particularly your mom's. It's interesting that you mention trying to prove yourself through your job and other accomplishments, and yet, despite those successes, you still feel like you're not good enough. Can you explore with me what you think would happen if you were to let go of this need for validation from others? What would that look like for you, and what benefits do you think you might experience as a result?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>That's a really thought-provoking question, and I think it's something I've never really considered before. If I were to let go of this need for validation from others, I think it would mean that I would no longer be so focused on pleasing everyone else and trying to prove myself. I would be able to focus more on my own goals and aspirations, and not let the opinions of others dictate my self-worth.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're carrying a heavy burden of needing to prove yourself to others, and that it's been a long-standing pattern for you. I'm curious, what would happen if you were to take a step back and acknowledge that your worth and value come from within, rather than from external validation? How do you think that would change the way you show up in your daily life, especially in your interactions with customers?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think that would be a huge relief, to be honest. If I could let go of the need for validation from others, I would no longer be so anxious and worried about making mistakes or not being good enough. I would be able to focus on what I'm good at and what I enjoy doing, rather than trying to prove myself to others. And I think that would also help me to form more meaningful connections with customers, because I wouldn't be so focused on trying to impress them. I would be able to be more authentic and genuine in my interactions with them, and I think that would lead to more positive and fulfilling relationships.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're carrying a lot of weight from trying to prove yourself to others, and that it's been a long-standing pattern for you. I want to acknowledge that it takes a lot of courage to realize this and to be willing to explore new ways of being. It sounds like you're starting to tap into the idea that your worth and value come from within, rather than from external validation. Can you explore with me what it would mean to embody that sense of self-worth in your daily life, especially in your interactions with customers? How do you think that would change the way you show up, and what kind of impact do you think it would have on your relationships with them?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think it's interesting that I've been so focused on trying to prove myself to others, and yet, I've been neglecting my own needs and desires. I've been so caught up in trying to meet others' expectations that I've lost sight of what's truly important to me.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're starting to uncover a deeper sense of self-awareness and understanding of what's driving your need for validation from others. Can you tell me more about what you think it would take for you to truly embody this sense of self-worth in your daily life? What small steps can you take today or this week to start practicing self-acceptance and self-compassion, especially in your interactions with customers?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think that's a really great question, and it's something I've never really considered before. Embodiment is a concept that's been on my mind a lot lately, and I think it's something that I need to work on.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're starting to unpack the deep-seated patterns that have been driving your need for validation from others. Embodiment is a powerful concept, and it's great that you're considering how you can bring this sense of self-worth into your daily life, especially in your interactions with customers. Can you tell me more about what you think it would mean to embody this sense of self-worth in your daily life? For example, what would you do differently, what would you say to yourself, what would you focus on?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>That's a really thought-provoking question, and I think it's something I've never really considered before. If I were to embody this sense of self-worth in my daily life, I think I would focus more on being present and mindful in my interactions with customers. I would try to be more authentic and genuine, rather than trying to impress them or prove myself. I would also focus on listening more and responding thoughtfully, rather than worrying about what they think of me. Additionally, I would try to be kinder to myself and practice self-compassion, especially when I make mistakes or don't meet expectations.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're really tuning into the idea that your worth and value come from within, and that's a powerful realization. I'm curious, what do you think would happen if you were to start practicing self-acceptance and self-compassion in your daily life, especially in your interactions with customers? How do you think that would impact your relationships with them, and what benefits do you think you might experience as a result?</div>
