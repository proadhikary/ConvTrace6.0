                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Hello Monica, it's nice to meet you. How are you feeling today?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I’m just really overwhelmed by these feelings of anxiety at work. It’s like I can’t shake the fear that every customer interaction will go badly, even though I try my best.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're really struggling with a lot of anxiety on the job, and it's affecting your confidence in interacting with customers. Can you tell me more about what specifically is triggering these feelings of fear and dread? Is it a particular situation or type of customer that's causing you distress?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Honestly, I think it's just the uncertainty of not knowing how customers are going to react to me. I've had a few negative experiences in the past, and it's like my brain is just stuck on the idea that the next customer is going to be difficult or rude.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're carrying around a sense of hypervigilance, always anticipating the worst-case scenario. Can you tell me more about what happened in those past negative experiences that have led you to expect difficulty or rudeness from customers?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>To be honest, it's hard for me to pinpoint a specific incident that triggered this anxiety, but I think it's just a combination of feeling like I'm not good enough at my job and being worried that I'll make a mistake and get criticized by a customer.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're carrying around a lot of self-doubt and fear of judgment, which is making it hard for you to feel confident in your abilities. Can you tell me more about what you mean by 'not good enough' at your job? Is there something specific that you feel like you're not doing well or that you're worried about not doing well?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah, I guess I just feel like I'm not living up to my own expectations. I'm always worried that I'll say or do something wrong, and it's like my mind is constantly replaying all the things that could go wrong.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're putting a lot of pressure on yourself to be perfect and are worried about making mistakes. Can you tell me more about what you think would happen if you did make a mistake? Is it that you would lose your job or that customers would never come back? What are some of the thoughts that go through your mind when you think about making a mistake?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>It's like, I'll be walking around, thinking about all these worst-case scenarios, and it's hard to shake that feeling. Sometimes I'll be in the middle of a conversation with a customer, and suddenly I'll think, Oh no, I'm about to mess this up. It's like my brain is constantly on high alert, waiting for something to go wrong, and it's exhausting.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're experiencing a lot of self-generated anxiety, and it's affecting your ability to engage with customers in a positive way. It's like you're stuck in a cycle of catastrophic thinking, where you're constantly replaying worst-case scenarios in your head. Can you tell me more about what you think would happen if you were able to break free from this cycle of catastrophic thinking? What would that look like for you?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think if I could break free from this cycle of catastrophic thinking, I would feel more confident and calm when interacting with customers. I would be able to focus on providing good customer service instead of worrying about making mistakes. I would feel more in control and less anxious, which would allow me to enjoy my job more and not dread coming to work every day.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're carrying around a lot of mental weight, constantly anticipating the worst-case scenario and replaying negative outcomes in your head. That can be really exhausting and debilitating. I'm wondering, have you noticed any patterns or triggers that tend to set off these catastrophic thoughts? Are there any specific times of day, certain environments, or particular people that tend to trigger these worries?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah, I think I can definitely see that pattern happening. I notice that I tend to get more anxious when I'm already feeling stressed or overwhelmed, like during peak shopping hours or when we're short-staffed. And sometimes, just seeing a difficult-looking customer coming towards me can trigger those thoughts. But I think it's not just limited to those situations. Even just thinking about a difficult customer interaction days later can still trigger those catastrophic thoughts and keep me up at night.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're experiencing a lot of anxiety and self-doubt, which is affecting your ability to feel confident and calm when interacting with customers. Can you tell me more about what you think would happen if you were able to challenge some of these catastrophic thoughts and replace them with more balanced or realistic ones? For example, what if instead of thinking I'm going to mess this up, you thought I've prepared well for this conversation and I can handle whatever comes up?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Client:</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Can you help me understand what you mean by I've prepared well for this conversation and I can handle whatever comes up? How would I go about doing that, and what would that look like in practice?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah, I think it's hard for me to imagine a scenario where I'm not worried about messing up. It's like my brain is always defaulting to that worst-case scenario. But I can see how replacing those thoughts with more balanced ones could help me feel more confident and calm. Maybe I could remind myself that I've had success in similar situations in the past, or that I've prepared well for this conversation and I can handle whatever comes up.</div>

This can be really exhausting and debilitating. I'm wondering, have you considered keeping a thought journal to track some of these catastrophic thoughts and patterns? Sometimes writing down our thoughts and patterns can help us identify triggers and gain insight into what's driving these worries. Would you be open to trying that?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think that's a great idea. Writing down my thoughts and patterns might help me identify some of the triggers and gain insight into what's driving these catastrophic thoughts.
