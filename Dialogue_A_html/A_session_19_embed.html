                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Hi David, Iâ€™m glad you reached out for support. How are you feeling today?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I've been having trouble sleeping and eating properly because I keep thinking about what could go wrong with my exams or graduation. Even when I try to focus on my studies, these thoughts keep creeping in, making it hard to concentrate.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>I can sense how overwhelmed and anxious you must be feeling, David. It sounds like these worries about exams and graduation are really taking a toll on your daily life. Can you tell me more about what's specifically going through your mind when you're lying awake at night or trying to focus on your studies? What are some of the worst-case scenarios you're imagining?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>That's a great question. When I'm lying awake at night, I start thinking about all the things that could go wrong, like not passing my exams, not graduating on time, or not getting the job I want. I imagine myself failing, feeling embarrassed, and being a disappointment to my family. It's like I'm replaying all these worst-case scenarios in my head, and it's hard to stop.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're experiencing a lot of catastrophic thinking, where you're imagining the absolute worst possible outcomes. It's like your mind is creating this catastrophic narrative that's hard to shake off. Have you noticed any patterns or triggers that might be contributing to these thoughts, or is it just a constant stream of worries in your mind?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah, I think it's just a constant stream of worries in my mind. It feels like my brain is always racing with all these worst-case scenarios, and it's hard to turn it off. But I do notice that my anxiety tends to spike when I'm getting close to a deadline or when I'm facing a big exam. It's like my brain is hyping up the potential risks and consequences, making it even harder for me to focus.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're experiencing a lot of anticipatory anxiety, which is completely normal when you're facing significant challenges like exams and graduation. It's as if your brain is trying to prepare you for the worst-case scenario by amplifying the potential risks and consequences. Can you tell me more about what you think might happen if you don't meet your own expectations or if things don't go exactly as planned? What are some of the underlying fears or concerns that might be driving this catastrophic thinking?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>That's a great question. I think I'm afraid of not being in control of my life, and that these upcoming exams and graduation requirements will expose my lack of control. I'm also worried about disappointing my family, especially my parents, who have always been supportive of me. I imagine that if I don't achieve my goals, they'll be ashamed of me or think I'm not good enough. It's like I'm carrying this weight of responsibility to succeed, and if I don't, I'll let everyone down.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're shouldering a significant amount of responsibility not just for your own success, but also for your family's expectations. It's as if you're carrying the weight of their hopes and dreams on your shoulders. Can you tell me more about what you think your family's expectations are, and how you think they might change if you don't meet them? Are there any specific things they've said or done that might be contributing to your sense of responsibility?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I've noticed that my parents have always been very supportive, but I think they're also putting a lot of pressure on me to succeed. My mom has been saying things like, You're so close to finishing, you just have to push through and get it done, and my dad has been talking about how proud they'll be if I can just finish strong. I think they're trying to motivate me, but it's also making me feel like I'm the only one who can make this happen, and that if I fail, I'll be letting them down.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like your parents' words of encouragement, although well-intentioned, have taken on a more critical tone in your mind. It's possible that you're internalizing their expectations and feelings of responsibility, making it feel like the weight of their hopes and dreams rests solely on your shoulders. Can you explore with me how you think you might be able to have an open and honest conversation with your parents about your feelings and concerns, so that you can begin to shift this sense of responsibility and create a more balanced dynamic between your own goals and their expectations?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah, I think that would be really helpful. I've been avoiding talking to them about my worries because I don't want to let them down or disappoint them. But at the same time, I feel like they're not really listening to me or understanding what I'm going through. Maybe we can work on me communicating my feelings and concerns to them in a way that doesn't make them worry more, but also helps them understand what's going on with me.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're feeling a lot of pressure and responsibility to meet your parents' expectations, and that's contributing to your anxiety and catastrophic thinking. I think it's really important to recognize that your parents' words of encouragement, although well-intentioned, may not be helpful in this situation. Instead of trying to motivate you to succeed, it might be more helpful for them to offer emotional support and understanding. Can you imagine having a conversation with them where you express your feelings and concerns, and ask for their support and understanding rather than their encouragement? How do you think that might go, and what are some specific things you'd like to say to them?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>That's a great point. I think if I can have an open and honest conversation with my parents about my feelings and concerns, it might help them understand what I'm going through and not put so much pressure on me to succeed. Maybe we can work on me communicating my feelings and concerns to them in a way that doesn't make them worry more, but also helps them understand what's going on with me.</div>

                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I can see how my catastrophic thinking is affecting my daily life, and I understand how I'm internalizing my parents' expectations and feelings of responsibility.

                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think it's really interesting that you're saying that my parents' words of encouragement might not be helpful in this situation. It makes sense that instead of trying to motivate me to succeed, they could offer emotional support and understanding. I can see how that would help me feel less pressure and anxiety.

                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're really starting to understand how your catastrophic thinking and feelings of responsibility are impacting your daily life, David. It's great that you're recognizing the importance of having an open and honest conversation with your parents about your feelings and concerns. Can you imagine taking a step back from your parents' expectations and focusing more on your own needs and goals? What would that look like for you, and how do you think that might help you feel more balanced and less anxious?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think taking a step back from my parents' expectations would mean not letting their words and actions dictate my sense of responsibility and self-worth. It would mean focusing on my own strengths and abilities, rather than trying to live up to their expectations. It would also mean being more intentional about setting boundaries and communicating my needs and feelings to them in a clear and respectful manner. I think that would help me feel more grounded and less anxious, and allow me to approach my exams and graduation requirements with a more positive and confident mindset.</div>
