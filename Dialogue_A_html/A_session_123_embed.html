                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Hi Brianna, thank you for joining me today. How are you feeling about having this session?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I don't really know what to expect. I guess I just feel kind of stuck with these negative thoughts.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Can you tell me more about what you mean by negative thoughts? What kind of things have been going through your mind lately that are making you feel stuck?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I don't know, it's just that everything seems so unfair and people are always judging me. Like, when my friends don't want to play League of Legends with me, I immediately think it's because I'm a bad gamer and they don't want to get crushed by me. It's like, I can't even have a normal conversation without thinking the worst about myself.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're experiencing a lot of self-doubt and criticism. It can be really frustrating and painful to feel like you're constantly putting yourself down and assuming the worst about others. Can you think of a specific situation or experience that might have contributed to these negative thought patterns? Is there something that's changed recently or a particular event that's making you feel this way?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah, I guess it started when I got really into League of Legends and people started to notice my skills. Some of my friends would make fun of me or say I'm too good, and I think that's when I started to feel like I'm not good enough. It's like, even when I'm doing well, I'm always worried that I'll mess up or that people will figure out I'm not as good as they think I am.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like the pressure to perform and the criticism from others has really affected your self-perception. It's like you're constantly trying to prove yourself, even to your own friends. Can you tell me more about what it's like for you to feel like you're walking on eggshells, always worried about making a mistake or being judged? How do you think this is impacting your daily life and relationships with others?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>It's just so hard to shake off these thoughts, you know? It feels like they're always lurking in the back of my mind, waiting to pounce and make me feel like a total failure. And even when I try to distract myself or focus on something else, they just keep coming back. It's like, I'll be playing a game and suddenly I'll think, Oh no, I'm going to mess up and everyone's going to see how bad I am. And then it's hard to even enjoy the game anymore because I'm so worried about what others are thinking.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like these negative thoughts are really pervasive and affecting your ability to enjoy activities and feel confident in yourself. It's like you're living under the constant pressure of being judged and not meeting others' expectations. Can you tell me more about what you think would happen if you were able to let go of these thoughts and just focus on playing the game for fun? What would that look like for you, and do you think you've ever experienced that before in any situation?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah, it's like... I feel like I'm stuck in this never-ending cycle of self-doubt and criticism. It's hard to imagine what it would be like to just let go of those thoughts and enjoy the game without worrying about what others think. I guess I've had moments where I've played a game and felt really good about it, but those moments are few and far between. When I do experience them, it's like... it's like a little glimpse of freedom, you know? Like, I can just be myself and enjoy the game without all the negative self-talk. But then those thoughts come back and I'm right back to square one. It's frustrating because I know I can do better, but I don't know how to get out of this cycle.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're feeling trapped in this cycle of self-doubt and criticism, and it's really affecting your ability to enjoy activities and feel confident in yourself. I want to acknowledge that it takes a lot of courage to share these feelings with me, and I'm here to support you in exploring ways to break free from this cycle. Can you tell me more about what you mean by little glimpses of freedom when you're playing the game and feeling good about it? What specifically happens in those moments that makes you feel like you're being yourself and enjoying the game without the negative self-talk?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah, it's like... when I'm in the zone, you know? I'm focused on the game, and I'm not thinking about what others think of me. I'm just playing and having fun. It's like, I'm not worried about making mistakes or being judged, and I can just be myself. It's a really freeing feeling, and it makes me realize that I don't have to be controlled by these negative thoughts. But then, as soon as I start to think about what others might think or worry about making a mistake, the doubts come back and I'm right back to square one.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like those moments of being in the zone and feeling fully engaged in the game are really powerful for you. It's like you're able to tap into a sense of freedom and self-acceptance that's hard to find in other moments. Can you think of any ways that you might be able to access that sense of freedom and self-acceptance more consistently, even when you're not necessarily in the zone?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>It's hard for me to imagine being able to access that sense of freedom and self-acceptance consistently, especially since the negative thoughts seem to come back so easily. But maybe if I could focus more on the process of playing the game, rather than the outcome or what others think, I could learn to enjoy it more without worrying about failure or judgment. Like, instead of thinking about how well I'm doing or how others are perceiving me, I could just focus on the gameplay and the fun of it. Maybe that could help me build more confidence and trust in myself, even when I'm not in the zone.</div>
