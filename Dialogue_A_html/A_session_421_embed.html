                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Hi Russell, it's nice to meet you. What brings you here today?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I've been stuck as a short order cook for years now, and no matter what I do—whether it's applying to other jobs or going to career workshops—I still feel trapped. It’s really affecting my motivation and happiness.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Can you tell me more about what you mean by trapped? What specific feelings come up for you when you think about your job and your situation?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Well, I feel like I'm stuck in a rut, like I'm not going anywhere in life. I see my friends advancing in their careers, and I feel like I'm just stuck in the same old routine. It's like my future is already mapped out for me, and I have no control over it.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>That sounds really frustrating and demotivating. It's like you're feeling stuck and powerless in your situation. Can you help me understand what you think is causing this feeling of being trapped? Is it something specific about your job, or is it more about the lack of control or direction in your life?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah, it's definitely about the lack of control and direction. I feel like I'm just going through the motions every day, and I'm not really living the life I want. It's like I'm just existing, not really thriving or growing. And it's hard for me to see a way out of it, because I don't know what else I could do or where I could go.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're feeling a sense of aimlessness and powerlessness, like you're not living the life you intended to live. It can be really overwhelming and demotivating to feel like you're just going through the motions without any sense of purpose or direction. Have you ever taken the time to reflect on what you value and what's important to you, and how that might relate to your current situation and your desires for the future?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah, I've thought about what I value and what's important to me, and I know I want to have a sense of fulfillment and purpose in my life. But, I don't know how to get there, and it feels like my current job is holding me back.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're struggling to align your current situation with your values and aspirations, and that's causing a sense of dissonance and frustration. Can you help me understand what specifically about your job feels unfulfilling or purposeless to you? Is it the work itself, the environment, the lack of growth opportunities, or something else entirely?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>It's hard to pinpoint exactly what it is, but I think it's a combination of things. Sometimes I feel like I'm just a cog in a machine, like I'm just a replaceable part. And other times, I feel like I'm not using my skills or talents to their full potential. It's like I'm just going through the motions, and it's not very fulfilling.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're feeling undervalued and unchallenged in your current role, which is contributing to your sense of purposelessness and frustration. Can you tell me more about what skills or talents you feel like you're not using to their full potential? Are there any specific aspects of your job or work environment that make you feel like you're just a cog in a machine?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think one of the biggest issues is that I'm not using my creativity at all in my current job. As a short order cook, I'm mostly just following a set routine and repeating the same tasks over and over again. It's like my creativity is being stifled, and that's not who I am as a person. I'm a creative person, and I need to be expressing myself in some way.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like the lack of creativity and autonomy in your job is really affecting your sense of purpose and fulfillment. It's like you're not being able to express yourself or use your talents in a way that feels authentic to you. Have you ever thought about exploring other career paths or jobs that might allow you to tap into your creativity and use your skills in a more meaningful way?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I've tried to explore other career paths, but it feels like every job I look at requires more education or experience than I have. It's like I'm stuck in a cycle of not being qualified enough, and it's really frustrating.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're feeling limited by your current job and the lack of creativity and autonomy it provides. You're also feeling like you're not using your skills and talents to their full potential, which is contributing to your sense of purposelessness and frustration. It's like you're feeling stuck and unsure of how to move forward. Can you help me understand what you mean by stuck in a cycle of not being qualified enough? Is it the fear of not having the right skills or education, or is it something else entirely?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think it's a mix of both. I feel like I'm not qualified enough because I don't have the right education or experience, but at the same time, I'm also afraid of not being good enough or not being able to keep up with the demands of a new job. It's like I'm caught in this cycle of self-doubt and uncertainty, and it's really hard for me to break free from it.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're struggling with a sense of stagnation and powerlessness in your current job, and that's affecting your overall sense of purpose and fulfillment. It's like you're feeling trapped and unsure of how to move forward. Can you help me understand what you think would need to happen for you to feel more in control and directed in your life? Is it a specific event, a change in your environment, or a shift in your perspective that you think would help you break free from this cycle of feeling stuck?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>It's hard to pinpoint exactly what would need to happen, but I think it would be helpful if I could see some kind of concrete opportunities or a clear path forward. Maybe a career coach or a mentor who could guide me and help me identify my strengths and weaknesses. I feel like I'm just drifting aimlessly right now, and a little bit of direction or guidance would go a long way.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're feeling really stuck and uncertain about your future, and that's causing a lot of frustration and anxiety for you. It's like you're feeling like you're just drifting along without a clear sense of direction or purpose. Can you help me understand what you mean by concrete opportunities or a clear path forward? What specifically would you need to see or experience in order to feel more directed and motivated in your life?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah, it's definitely about the lack of control and direction. I feel like I'm just going through the motions every day, and I'm not really living the life I want. It's like I'm just existing, not really thriving or growing. And it's hard for me to see a way out of it, because I don't know what else I could do or where I could go.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're feeling really stuck and uncertain about your future, and that's causing a lot of frustration and anxiety for you. It's like you're feeling like you're just drifting along without a clear sense of direction or purpose. I'm wondering if you've ever thought about setting some goals for yourself, even small ones, to help give you a sense of direction and momentum. What do you think about that?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I've tried setting goals for myself in the past, but they always seem to fall apart or get derailed. It's like I'm not really committed to making changes or I don't know how to make them happen.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you've encountered some challenges in the past when it comes to setting and achieving goals. Can you help me understand what you think is getting in the way of your ability to commit to and follow through on your goals? Is it self-doubt, lack of confidence, or something else entirely?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>It's a mix of everything, I think. Sometimes I feel like I'm just not good enough or capable enough to achieve my goals, and that thought alone can be really discouraging. And other times, I feel like I don't know how to make changes or take the first step towards achieving my goals, so I just don't try. It's like I'm stuck in this cycle of self-doubt and uncertainty, and it's really hard for me to break free from it.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're struggling with a lot of self-doubt and uncertainty, which is making it hard for you to set and achieve goals. It's like you're caught in this cycle of negative thinking and fear of failure. Have you ever tried reframing your thinking or challenging those negative thoughts? For example, instead of thinking I'm not good enough, what if you tried reframing it as I'm doing the best I can with the resources I have? Or instead of thinking I don't know how to make changes, what if you tried reframing it as I'm learning and growing every day?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think reframing my thinking could be helpful, but it's hard for me to do that when I'm stuck in this cycle of self-doubt and uncertainty. It's like my mind is always racing with negative thoughts and worries about the future.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're experiencing a lot of self-doubt and uncertainty, which is making it hard for you to break free from this cycle of feeling stuck. It's understandable that it's challenging to reframe your thinking when you're in the midst of these negative thoughts. Can you help me understand what you think would be a small, manageable step that you could take to start reframing your thinking or practicing self-compassion? Is it something specific, like writing down three things you're grateful for each day, or is it more about taking a few deep breaths and acknowledging your feelings?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I'm not sure what would be a small, manageable step for me to take. I feel like I've tried to do things in the past, but they haven't worked out. I'm not really sure what to do or where to start.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're feeling really stuck and uncertain about your future, and that's causing a lot of frustration and anxiety for you. It's like you're feeling like you're just drifting along without a clear sense of direction or purpose. I'm wondering if you could try keeping a journal or writing down your thoughts and feelings each day. This might help you process what you're thinking and feeling, and it could also give you a sense of control and direction. Would you be willing to try that?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think that could be helpful. Writing down my thoughts and feelings could be a good way to process everything and gain some clarity. It's just hard for me to know where to start or what to write about.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're feeling overwhelmed by your thoughts and feelings, and it's hard for you to know where to start or what to write about. That's completely normal! Let's take it one step at a time. Would you be willing to start by writing down three things that you're thinking about right now? They can be big or small things, it doesn't matter. Just write down whatever comes to mind.</div>

It's like you're feeling like you're just drifting along without a clear sense of direction or purpose.

                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>It's hard for me to pinpoint exactly what's truly important to me, because I feel like I've been stuck in this rut for so long. I know I want to be happy and fulfilled, but I don't know what that looks like or how to get there. I feel like I've been trying to fit into someone else's idea of what I should be doing, rather than following my own path.</div>

                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think the counseling sessions have been helpful so far, but I'm not sure if I'm making progress.
