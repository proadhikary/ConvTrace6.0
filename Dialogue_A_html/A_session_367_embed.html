                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Hi Derek, I'm glad you could join me today. What brings you here?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I've been feeling really guilty about not spending every moment preparing for college. It feels like I can't take a break without feeling stressed or exhausted.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Can you tell me more about what's going on that's making you feel like you need to be constantly preparing for college? Is there something specific that's causing you to feel like you're not doing enough?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Honestly, I don't know if it's just the pressure from my parents and friends, or if it's just my own expectations, but it feels like I need to be constantly prepared to meet everyone's standards, including my own.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're feeling a lot of pressure from multiple sources, and that can be really overwhelming. Can you help me understand what these standards are that you're trying to meet? Are they specific grades, extracurricular activities, or something else entirely?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah, it's a mix of everything. My parents are always asking me about my grades, and my friends are always talking about their own college prep and how they're getting ahead of the game. And then there's my own expectations, like I want to make sure I'm taking the right classes and getting good internships. It's like I'm constantly comparing myself to others and feeling like I'm not good enough.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're not only trying to meet your own expectations, but also the expectations of your parents and friends. That can create a lot of stress and anxiety. Have you noticed any patterns or common themes among these expectations, or do they all feel equally important to you?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah, it's like I said, it's a mix of everything. And I think what's also making it hard is that I'm not even sure what I want to study in college. I feel like I need to have a clear plan, but at the same time, I'm scared of not making the right choice and ending up stuck or unhappy.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're feeling a lot of pressure to make a specific plan for your future, but at the same time, you're not entirely sure what that plan should be. That can be a really uncertain and scary place to be. Can you help me understand what's driving this need for a clear plan? Is it a fear of not being in control, or is it a fear of not meeting others' expectations?Client:</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>It's definitely a mix of both, I think. I don't want to feel like I'm not in control of my own life, but at the same time, I don't want to disappoint my parents or friends by not making the right choices. I feel like I'm stuck between these two fears, and it's making it hard for me to relax and enjoy the process of figuring out what I want to study in college.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're struggling with a sense of responsibility to others, while also feeling uncertain about your own desires and goals. This conflict between controlling your life and meeting others' expectations can be really overwhelming. Have you noticed any times when you've felt more in control or confident, even if it's just for a moment? What was happening in that moment that made you feel that way?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>That's a good question. I think one time when I felt more in control was when I decided to take a break from studying for a day and go on a hike with my friends. It was a really nice day, and we had a great time just being outdoors and not thinking about college or grades. For a few hours, I completely forgot about all the pressure and stress, and I felt like I was just being me.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like taking a break and engaging in an activity that brought you joy and connection with friends helped you feel more in control and relaxed. Can you help me understand what it was about that experience that made you feel like you were just being yourself? Was it the distraction from the pressure and stress, or was it something more profound that happened for you in that moment?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think it was a combination of both. The distraction from the pressure and stress was definitely a big part of it, but it was also the feeling of being fully present in the moment and not worrying about what others thought of me. I felt like I was just being me, without any labels or expectations attached to it. When I'm usually thinking about college or grades, I feel like I'm constantly trying to live up to someone else's standards, but when I'm doing something I enjoy, like going on a hike, I feel like I'm living my own life.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like that experience of going on a hike and being fully present in the moment was really powerful for you. It's almost as if you were able to step out of the constant comparison and pressure to meet others' expectations and just be yourself. Can you help me understand what you think would need to happen for you to have more moments like that, where you feel like you're living your own life and not just trying to live up to others' standards?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think what would need to happen is for me to prioritize my own desires and needs more often. Like, instead of constantly putting everyone else's expectations first, I need to make time for things that bring me joy and make me feel fulfilled. It's hard for me to do that right now because I feel like I'm always being pulled in different directions, but if I could find a way to balance my own needs with the pressure to meet others' expectations, I think I would feel more in control and relaxed.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're recognizing the importance of prioritizing your own desires and needs, and that's a great insight. Can you help me understand what specific steps you think you might need to take to make that happen? For example, are there any small changes you could make to your daily routine or habits that would help you focus more on your own needs and less on trying to meet others' expectations?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think one step I could take is to start scheduling time for myself each day, like taking a few minutes to meditate or go for a walk. It's easy to get caught up in the pressure to constantly be doing something productive, but I think having some downtime to focus on my own needs would help me feel more grounded and centered.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're recognizing the importance of prioritizing your own desires and needs, and that's a great insight. Scheduling time for yourself each day is a great idea, but I'm wondering if you've thought about what you would actually do with that time. Would you focus on something that brings you joy, like a hobby or activity you enjoy, or would you use that time to reflect on your thoughts and feelings about the pressure to meet others' expectations?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think I would use that time to reflect on my thoughts and feelings about the pressure to meet others' expectations. I feel like I've been so focused on trying to live up to everyone else's standards that I've lost touch with what I truly want and need. By taking a few minutes each day to reflect on my feelings and thoughts, I hope to gain a better understanding of myself and what I need to prioritize my own desires and needs.</div>

Using that time to reflect on your thoughts and feelings about the pressure to meet others' expectations could be really powerful in helping you gain a better understanding of yourself and what you need to prioritize your own desires and needs. Can you tell me more about what you hope to gain from this reflection time? What specific questions or topics do you think you'll explore during this time?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I'm hoping to gain a better understanding of why I feel so much pressure to meet others' expectations, and what specific needs I have that are being neglected because of it. I think during this reflection time, I'll explore questions like what are my core values and priorities, what brings me joy and fulfillment, and what are some small steps I can take each day to prioritize my own needs and desires.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're recognizing the importance of prioritizing your own desires and needs, and that's a great insight.

                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think what's been missing for me is a sense of purpose and direction. I've been so focused on trying to meet everyone else's expectations that I've lost sight of what I truly want and need. I hope that by reflecting on my thoughts and feelings, I'll be able to gain a better understanding of what my core values and priorities are, and what small steps I can take each day to prioritize my own needs and desires.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're recognizing a sense of purpose and direction as something that's been missing for you. That's a great place to start. Can you help me understand what you mean by purpose and direction? Is it about finding a specific career path or major in college, or is it more about having a sense of meaning and fulfillment in your daily life?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think it's a mix of both. I want to find a career path that aligns with my values and passions, but at the same time, I want to feel like I'm making progress towards my goals and feeling fulfilled in my daily life.</div>

                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're feeling a lot of pressure to meet others' expectations, whether it's from your parents, friends, or even your own expectations of yourself.

I would no longer feel like I'm constantly trying to live up to someone else's standards, and I would be able to focus on my own desires and needs. I would be able to prioritize my own happiness and fulfillment, rather than trying to meet everyone else's expectations. I would be able to take risks and try new things, without fear of failure or judgment from others. I would be able to be myself, without apology or pretension.

                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>It's hard for me to imagine letting go of these expectations completely, but I think I need to start by being kinder to myself and acknowledging that it's okay to not meet everyone's standards all the time.

I also need to prioritize my own needs and desires, even if that means saying no to things that don't align with who I am or what I want.</div>
