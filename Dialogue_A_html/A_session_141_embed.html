                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Hello, Evelyn. It’s nice to meet you. How can I assist you today?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>It’s just that every time a plant looks a bit off, I start thinking that the whole garden is doomed. I can’t seem to shake the feeling that I'm failing at this, and it's consuming a lot of my time and energy.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>I can imagine how overwhelming that must feel. It sounds like you're taking on a lot of responsibility for the garden's success, and when things don't go as planned, it feels like a personal failure. Can you tell me more about what you mean by a bit off? What specifically are you noticing that's causing you concern?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I guess it's just the little things, like a leaf that's not unfurling properly or a flower that's not blooming as expected. It's like, I know it's just a small part of the garden, but it feels like it's a sign that everything is going to fall apart. And then I start thinking about all the things I could've done differently and how I must be doing something wrong.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like those small imperfections in the plants are serving as a trigger for you to worry about the bigger picture. It's interesting that you mention what I could've done differently - can you tell me more about what you mean by that? Are you beating yourself up over past decisions or actions, or are you worried about things that might happen in the future?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah, I guess I just feel like I'm not doing enough or doing things wrong. Even when I try to help a struggling plant, I end up making it worse. It's like, I don't know what to do, and that feeling of helplessness is really frustrating.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're experiencing a lot of self-doubt and frustration when it comes to caring for your plants. It's like you're putting a lot of pressure on yourself to be perfect, and when things don't go according to plan, you feel like a failure. Can you tell me more about what you think would happen if you made it worse? What are you afraid of, and what would that mean for you?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah, I guess I'm afraid that if I make a mistake, it's going to spread to other plants and then the whole garden will be ruined. And then I'll feel like I've failed as a gardener, and that thought is just really overwhelming to me.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're carrying a lot of weight on your shoulders, Evelyn. Your fear of making a mistake is not just about the plants, but about your sense of identity and competence as a gardener. It's as if you're worried that if you're not perfect, you'll lose your sense of self-worth. Can you tell me more about what it would mean to you if you did lose that sense of self-worth? What would be the impact on your daily life and relationships?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think if I lost my sense of self-worth as a gardener, it would be devastating. I would feel like I'm failing not just as a gardener, but as a person. It would affect my relationships with my friends and family, because they would see me as someone who can't even take care of a simple garden. And at work, I would feel like I'm not good enough to do my job, and that would be really hard for me to deal with.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like the sense of self-worth you've tied to your gardening is closely tied to your sense of identity and competence. It's like you're carrying a heavy burden of responsibility on your shoulders. Can you explore with me why you think it's so important to be a perfect gardener? Is there something specific that happened in the past that has led you to feel this way, or is it something that's developed over time?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah, I think it's something that's developed over time. I've always been very passionate about gardening, and I guess I've always felt like I'm not good enough or doing things wrong. Even when I was a kid, my mom would always find fault in my gardening efforts, and it made me feel like I was never good enough. And now, as an adult, I'm carrying that same feeling of inadequacy with me. It's like, I'm trying to prove to myself and others that I'm capable of doing something right, but it's always just out of reach.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're carrying a lot of emotional weight from your childhood experiences with gardening, and it's continuing to affect your sense of self-worth as an adult. It's like you're still trying to prove yourself, and that's creating a lot of pressure and anxiety for you. Can you explore with me how you think your mom's comments affected you, and how you think they contributed to your feelings of inadequacy around gardening?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah, I think it's something that's developed over time.

                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like your mom's comments had a profound impact on your sense of self-worth and confidence in gardening. It's as if you're still carrying around that feeling of never being good enough, and it's influencing your behavior as an adult. Can you tell me more about what you think your mom was trying to communicate with her criticism? Was she trying to help you improve, or was it more about her own anxieties and expectations?</div>

                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like your mom's criticism was a way of expressing her own anxieties and expectations, rather than a genuine attempt to help you improve. It's like she was trying to project her own fears and doubts onto you, and that's had a lasting impact on your sense of self-worth. Can you explore with me how you think that's affected your relationship with your mom, and how you've internalized those feelings of inadequacy?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think I've been trying to prove to myself and others that I'm capable of doing something right, but it's always just out of reach. I've been so focused on being perfect that I've forgotten what I originally loved about gardening - the joy and relaxation it brings me. I think I've been using my garden as a way to cope with the feelings of inadequacy and self-doubt that I've been carrying around since childhood. I'm not sure how to stop this cycle of negative thinking and self-criticism, but I know I need to find a way to reframe my relationship with my garden and myself.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you've been carrying around a lot of emotional baggage from your childhood experiences with gardening, and it's affecting your sense of self-worth and confidence in your abilities as an adult.

                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're struggling with a lot of self-doubt and pressure to be perfect, not just in your gardening, but in your entire sense of self-worth. It's like you're carrying around this weight of expectation and criticism, and it's affecting your ability to enjoy the things you once loved, like gardening. Can you help me understand what you think would happen if you were to let go of this need to be perfect and just allowed yourself to be okay with making mistakes and imperfections in your garden? What would that mean for you, and how do you think it could change your relationship with yourself and your garden?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think if I let go of the need to be perfect, I would feel a sense of freedom and relief. I would be able to enjoy the process of gardening without feeling like I'm under a microscope. I would be able to make mistakes and learn from them without beating myself up over it. I would be able to appreciate the beauty and simplicity of gardening without feeling like I need to achieve some kind of perfection.</div>
