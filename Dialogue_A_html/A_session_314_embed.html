                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Hello, Gerald. Thank you for joining our session today. How are you feeling about being here?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Well, like I mentioned, I'm not really sure if this will help. I just don't get why the endings of books bother me so much. It feels like I'm setting myself up for disappointment every time I start a new one.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>That's a great point, Gerald. It sounds like you're feeling a sense of anticipation and hope when you start a new book, and then that hope is crushed when it comes to an end. Can you tell me more about what specifically happens for you when a book ends? Is it the feeling of saying goodbye to the characters, or something else entirely?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Honestly, I'm not sure what it is. It's just that the endings always feel so... unsatisfying. Like, I invest all this time and emotion into the story, and then it just ends and I'm left with nothing. It's like I've been building up to this moment, and then it's just taken away from me. And it's not even like the endings are always bad, it's just... I dunno, it's like I'm expecting something more, and it's always a letdown.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like the endings of books are leaving you with a sense of loss and a feeling that you're not getting what you were expecting. Can you help me understand what you mean by something more? What specifically are you expecting from a book's ending that you're not getting?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I'm not sure, it's just that I feel like I'm always left with this feeling of emptiness or sadness, like I've been pulled out of this world that I've been invested in and brought back to reality. It's like I've been living in this fantasy world for a while, and then suddenly it's ripped away from me.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're expecting a sense of completion or fullness from the ending of a book, something that would leave you feeling satisfied and fulfilled. Instead, the endings often leave you with a sense of loss and a feeling of being disconnected from the world you've been immersed in. Can you help me understand what you think would make an ending feel more complete or satisfying to you? Is it a specific type of ending, such as a happy ending or a certain kind of resolution?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>That's a good point, I think. I guess I'm looking for something that would make me feel like I've accomplished something or reached a certain goal. Maybe it's like a sense of closure or a feeling that I've been a part of something bigger than myself. But at the same time, I'm also scared of getting too attached to a story and then having it taken away from me. It's like I'm stuck in this cycle of wanting to experience the joy of reading, but also being afraid of getting hurt.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're looking for a sense of accomplishment and closure from the endings of books, something that would give you a sense of fulfillment and satisfaction. It's almost like you're seeking a sense of completion, where you feel like you've reached a certain goal or been a part of something bigger than yourself. Can you help me understand what you think is driving this need for closure and accomplishment? Is it a sense of control or a desire to feel like you've gotten the most out of the experience?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think it's because I've always been someone who likes to have things figured out and understood. I like to know how things are going to end before they even start. And when a book ends in a way that doesn't make sense to me, it's like I'm left with this sense of unease and uncertainty. It's like I'm being told that there's more to the story than what I can see, and that's really uncomfortable for me.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're looking for control and understanding over the story and its outcome. You prefer to know how things will end before they begin, and when the ending is unexpected or doesn't make sense to you, it can be unsettling and uncertain. This desire for control and understanding is understandable, but it's also interesting that you're acknowledging a sense of unease and discomfort when you're faced with uncertainty. Can you help me understand what you think would happen if you were to let go of the need to have things figured out and understood? Would you feel more comfortable or anxious?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I'm not sure, it sounds like I'm trying to exert control over something that's inherently unpredictable. Maybe if I could accept that sometimes things won't make sense or have a clear resolution, I could reduce my anxiety and discomfort. But at the same time, it's hard for me to let go of that need for control, it's like it's a part of who I am.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're recognizing that your need for control and understanding is tied to your sense of identity and comfort. It's understandable that you're struggling to let go of that need, as it's been a part of who you are for a while. Can you help me understand what you think would happen if you were to take small steps towards accepting uncertainty and unpredictability in your life? Would you feel like you're losing yourself or your sense of identity?</div>

                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're recognizing that your need for control and understanding is deeply ingrained and tied to your sense of identity. It's understandable that you're hesitant to let go of that need, as it's been a part of who you are for a while. Can you help me understand what you think would happen if you were to take small steps towards accepting uncertainty and unpredictability in your life? Would you feel like you're losing yourself or your sense of identity?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think I see what's going on here. I've been using this need for control and understanding as a way to avoid feeling uncertain or uncomfortable. But maybe that's not the only way to deal with uncertainty. Maybe I can learn to accept it and find ways to cope with it that don't involve trying to control everything. It's scary to think about, but maybe it's worth exploring.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're starting to recognize that your need for control and understanding is actually a coping mechanism to avoid uncertainty, and that's a really important insight. It takes a lot of courage to acknowledge that we might be using our defenses as a way to avoid feeling vulnerable or uncertain. Can you help me understand what you think would be the benefits of taking small steps towards accepting uncertainty and unpredictability in your life? What might you gain from letting go of the need for control and understanding?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think I've been stuck in this pattern of trying to control everything because I'm afraid of feeling uncertain or uncomfortable. But the more I think about it, the more I realize that I'm actually missing out on a lot of experiences because I'm too afraid to take the leap and let go of control. Maybe it's time for me to start embracing uncertainty and see where it takes me.</div>

                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>It's funny, I never thought about it this way. I think I've been so focused on the endings of books being unsatisfying that I never stopped to consider what I'm actually getting out of the experience. It's like I'm so focused on the destination that I'm not paying attention to the journey. Maybe I need to start focusing on the process of reading rather than the outcome, and see where that takes me.</div>
