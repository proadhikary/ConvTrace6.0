                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Hi Michael, welcome. How are you feeling today?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I appreciate you asking. Honestly, the anxiety is consuming me. I keep thinking about how being late even once could ruin my reputation at work and lead to me losing my job. It's hard to focus on anything else right now.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're feeling overwhelmed by these worries about being late and its potential consequences. Can you tell me more about what's been going on that's causing you to feel so anxious about being on time? Is there anything specific that's happened in the past that's making you feel this way?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah, I think it's just the pressure to perform at Google, and the fear of failure is really intense. I've always been someone who sets high standards for myself, and the thought of not meeting those standards is unbearable. But I've never had a major slip-up like this before, and it's making me realize that even one mistake can have catastrophic consequences.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Can you help me understand what you mean by catastrophic consequences? What specific scenarios or outcomes do you envision if you were to be late just once?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah, I think it's the fear of being perceived as unreliable or incompetent, and that it could affect my chances of getting promoted or even being let go. I imagine my colleagues talking about me behind my back, thinking I'm not responsible or capable. It's like my whole career is at stake because of one little mistake.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like the fear of being perceived as unreliable or incompetent is a significant concern for you, and it's causing you to catastrophize about the potential consequences of being late. Can you tell me more about how you think your colleagues would react to you being late, and what you think would happen as a result?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah, I think it's the fear of being perceived as unreliable or incompetent, and that it could affect my chances of getting promoted or even being let go. I imagine my colleagues talking about me behind my back, thinking I'm not responsible or capable. It's like my whole career is at stake because of one little mistake.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're imagining a worst-case scenario where your colleagues would view you as irresponsible and incapable, and that this would lead to significant consequences for your career. Can you help me understand what you think would happen if your colleagues did view you in this way? Would they start to exclude you from projects or meetings, or would you feel like an outcast in the company?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>That's a good question. I think if my colleagues thought I was unreliable or incompetent, they would start to question my abilities and my role in the company. I would feel like I'm no longer a valuable asset, and that would be devastating.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're imagining a scenario where your colleagues would not only view you as unreliable, but also as someone who's no longer valuable or capable. That must be a really scary thought for you. Can you help me understand what you think you would do in that situation, or how you would cope with feeling like you're no longer valued by your colleagues?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah, it's really overwhelming to think about, and it's hard for me to imagine how I would even function in a work environment where my colleagues don't respect or value me. It's like, what's the point of even showing up to work if I'm just going to be seen as a failure?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're envisioning a scenario where your colleagues would not only question your abilities, but also your worth as a person and a professional. You're worried that being perceived as unreliable or incompetent would not only impact your career, but also your sense of identity and self-worth. It's understandable that this would be a really scary and overwhelming thought for you. Can you tell me more about how you would typically cope with feelings of failure or not meeting your own high standards? Are there any coping mechanisms or strategies that you've used in the past to deal with these kinds of feelings?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah, I think in the past, I've tried to distract myself from the negative thoughts by focusing on work or other activities. I've also tried to rationalize the situation by telling myself that it's just one late day and it's not the end of the world. But this time, it feels different. The anxiety is so intense that I can't shake the feeling that I'm going to get fired. It's like my brain has taken over and is playing these worst-case scenarios over and over again, making it hard for me to focus on anything else.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're using distraction and rationalization as coping mechanisms in the past, but this time, the anxiety is so intense that it's taking over and making it hard for you to focus on anything else. It's like your brain is stuck on these worst-case scenarios. Can you help me understand what you think is driving this intense anxiety? Is there something specific that's triggering this fear of failure and catastrophic consequences, or is it more of a general feeling that's been building up over time?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah, I think it's just the pressure to perform at Google, and the fear of failure is really intense.

                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like the pressure to perform at Google is taking a toll on your mental well-being, and the fear of failure is causing you to catastrophize about the potential consequences of being late. It's understandable that the thought of not meeting your own high standards is unbearable, and it's making you feel anxious and overwhelmed. Can you help me understand what you think you would gain from meeting your high standards, or what would happen if you didn't meet them? Is there something specific that you're striving for, or is it more of a general sense of self-worth?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think it's the fear of not living up to my own expectations and the pressure to constantly perform at a high level. I've always prided myself on being a high achiever, and the thought of not meeting those expectations is devastating to me. But at the same time, I feel like I'm being too hard on myself, and that my fear of failure is driving me to constantly strive for perfection. It's like I've lost sight of what's truly important and I'm just focused on meeting these arbitrary standards.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like the pressure to perform at Google is not only driving your fear of failure, but also your sense of self-worth. You feel that meeting your high standards is essential to your identity as a high achiever. Can you help me understand what you think would happen if you were able to let go of the need to constantly perform at a high level and focus on what's truly important to you? How do you think that would impact your sense of identity and self-worth?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think that if I were able to let go of the need to constantly perform at a high level, I would feel a sense of relief and freedom from the constant pressure to be perfect. I would be able to focus on what's truly important to me, such as my relationships and personal growth, rather than just trying to meet arbitrary standards. I think that would allow me to be more authentic and genuine in my interactions with others, and I would no longer feel like I'm just going through the motions to impress others.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It takes a lot of courage to acknowledge the pressure to perform and the fear of failure that's driving your anxiety. It sounds like you're trapped in a cycle of self-criticism and perfectionism, where you're constantly striving to meet high standards and fear that if you don't, you'll be seen as incompetent or unreliable. Can you help me understand what you think would happen if you were able to break free from this cycle and focus on what's truly important to you? What would you gain, and what would you lose?</div>

                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think what's truly important to me is being able to show up authentically and genuinely in my relationships, whether it's with my colleagues or my personal life. I want to be able to connect with others on a deeper level and build meaningful relationships, rather than just trying to impress them with my achievements. I also want to focus on my personal growth and development, whether it's learning new skills or exploring my passions and interests outside of work. And I want to be able to prioritize my own well-being and self-care, rather than sacrificing my own needs for the sake of meeting high standards.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're caught between the pressure to perform at Google and your own high standards, which is causing you a lot of anxiety and self-doubt.

                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I understand what you're saying, and it's really helpful to see that I'm caught between these two competing pressures.

On the other hand, if I focus on what's truly important to me, like being authentic and genuine in my relationships, and prioritizing my own well-being and self-care, I'll feel more fulfilled and happy.
