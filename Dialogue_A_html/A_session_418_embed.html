                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Hi Hunter, thanks for coming in today. How are you doing?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I’ve been feeling pretty down about my performance lately. It's like no matter how hard I try, I can't shake this feeling that I'm not good enough because I didn’t go to a top-tier school.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Can you tell me more about what you mean by not good enough? What specific things are you comparing yourself to or feeling like you're not measuring up to because of your school?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Honestly, I feel like I'm constantly comparing myself to athletes who attended top-tier schools, and it's hard to shake off the feeling that I'm not as good as they are. I guess I feel like I'm not living up to my own expectations, and that's what's really bothering me.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Can you help me understand what you think those expectations are based on? Is it something you've always had, or did you pick them up from someone or something specific?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think my expectations came from my draft experience last year. I was surprised to be selected, and afterwards, I started comparing myself to other athletes who went to top-tier schools. I guess I felt like they were more deserving of being drafted because of their education. It's like I'm constantly trying to prove myself, and this feeling of inadequacy is holding me back.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like your expectations of yourself as an athlete and a person were significantly impacted by your draft experience and the comparisons you made with others. Can you tell me more about what it was like for you to feel like you were being judged or evaluated based on your school, and how that has affected your self-perception and confidence?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah, it's like I've been living in this constant state of self-doubt, wondering if I'm good enough or not. And it's not just about the draft or the comparisons, it's like I'm always trying to prove myself to others, and that's exhausting. I feel like I'm stuck in this cycle of negativity and self-criticism, and I don't know how to break free from it.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like the pressure to prove yourself and the constant comparisons to others have taken a toll on your mental health and well-being. It's understandable that you're feeling exhausted and stuck in this cycle of negativity. Can you tell me what you think would happen if you were to let go of these expectations and comparisons? What would that look like for you, and do you think it could help you break free from this cycle of self-doubt and self-criticism?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think if I could let go of these expectations and comparisons, I would feel a weight lifted off my shoulders. I would no longer be constantly worrying about what others think of me, and I would be able to focus on my own strengths and abilities. I would be able to play the game without the added stress of trying to prove myself to others.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're carrying a significant burden of self-doubt and pressure to prove yourself to others. It's interesting that you mentioned what it would look like if you were to let go of these expectations and comparisons. Can you explore with me what you think would happen if you were to actually take that step and let go of trying to prove yourself to others? Would you feel a sense of freedom or relief? Would you be able to tap into your inner strength and confidence without the added weight of these expectations?</div>

I also think it would be helpful to work on reframing my self-talk, so that I'm not constantly beating myself up over perceived failures or shortcomings.
