                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Hi Wendy, itâ€™s nice to meet you. How are you feeling today?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah, I mean, I'm just not sure how talking about it will actually help.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>I completely understand your skepticism, Wendy. It's natural to feel uncertain about sharing your thoughts and feelings with someone you don't know. Can you tell me what specifically is making you hesitant to talk about what's going on? Is there something in particular that's causing you distress?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I guess it's just that I don't know how you're going to help me. You can't really understand what it's like to be me, and I don't know if you've ever experienced anything like this before.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>I understand what you mean, Wendy. It can be really tough to trust someone new, especially when it comes to sharing personal struggles. I want to assure you that I'm here to listen without judgment and provide support to the best of my abilities. I don't expect to understand exactly what it's like to be you, but I'm willing to learn and work with you to find ways to address your concerns. Can you help me understand what's been going on that's causing you distress, even if it feels unique to your experience?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I don't know, it's just hard for me to believe that anything can really change. I've been feeling this way for so long, and nothing has ever helped me before.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you've had some disappointing experiences in the past, and that's making it hard for you to hope that therapy will be different. I want to acknowledge that it takes a lot of courage to share your story, and I'm here to listen and support you. Can you help me understand what specifically has made you feel like nothing has ever helped you before? Was it the treatments you received, or was it the way you were treated by others?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I don't think there's anything anyone can do to help me. I've tried talking to friends, and they just don't get it. And I don't know, maybe you'll just try to make me feel better and it won't really change anything either.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're feeling a sense of hopelessness and frustration with the fact that you've tried to talk to friends and others in the past, but didn't feel heard or understood. You're worried that I might do the same thing, and that's making it hard for you to trust me. Can you help me understand what specifically made you feel like your friends didn't get it? Was there something specific they said or did that made you feel like they weren't listening?</div>

                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Wendy, it sounds like you're feeling really stuck and unsure if anyone can truly understand or help you. It's understandable that you're worried about being dismissed or not heard. Can you help me understand what you mean when you say that your friends don't get it? What specifically do you feel like they're missing or not understanding about your experiences?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I don't know, it just feels like they're not really listening. They'll just tell me to toughen up or forget about it and that makes me feel like they're not really trying to understand what I'm going through. And even if they do try to listen, it's like they're just going through the motions and not really getting it.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're feeling like your friends aren't truly listening to you or trying to understand your experiences. They're giving you advice or telling you to just forget about it, which isn't helping you feel heard or understood. Can you help me understand what you mean by they're not really listening? Is it the way they respond, the things they say, or something else entirely?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah, I guess that's what it feels like. Like, they're just going through the motions and not really caring about what I'm going through. And even if they do try to listen, it's like they're just doing it because they feel sorry for me or something, not because they actually care.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're feeling like your friends aren't truly invested in understanding your experiences and emotions. It's like they're just going through the motions out of obligation or sympathy, rather than genuine curiosity and care. That must be really frustrating and isolating for you. Can you help me understand what you mean by they're just going through the motions? Is it the way they respond, the things they say, or something else entirely?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah, I mean, it's like they're not even trying to understand me, they're just trying to fix me or make me feel better, but that's not what I need right now. I need someone to listen to me and get it, you know?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're craving a deeper level of understanding and connection with others, and feeling like your friends aren't meeting that need. You're not just looking for someone to fix you or make you feel better, but someone who can truly get what you're going through. Can you help me understand what you mean by get it? What specifically do you feel like would make you feel like someone understands you?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I don't think I've ever really felt like anyone has truly understood me, not even my parents. They're always trying to tell me what to do or how to feel, but it's like they're just going through the motions too. I feel like I'm just a problem to be solved, not a person with feelings and thoughts.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you've had a lot of experiences where you've felt like you're not being heard or understood, and that's really painful and isolating. It's like you're feeling like you're just a problem to be solved, rather than a person with your own thoughts and feelings. Can you help me understand what it would take for you to feel like someone understands you? What would make you feel like you're not just a problem to be solved, but a person who's worth listening to and understanding?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>It's hard for me to imagine that anyone could truly understand me, because I've never really felt like anyone has taken the time to try. Even my parents, who are supposed to love me unconditionally, always seem to be trying to fix me or tell me what to do. It feels like they're just going through the motions, and that's really hurtful.</div>

And even if they did try to understand me, I don't know if I could trust them enough to open up and be honest with them. It feels like I've been letting people down by not being honest with them, and that's really hard for me to deal with.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're carrying a lot of pain and mistrust from past experiences, and it's making it hard for you to believe that anyone could truly understand you.

                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I don't know how to even begin to trust you, or trust that you can really understand me. It feels like I've been let down by everyone in my life, including my parents and friends. I'm not sure why I should expect anything different from you, even though you seem genuinely interested in listening to me.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>I completely understand your concerns, Wendy. It's natural to feel skeptical and uncertain about trusting someone new, especially when you've had negative experiences in the past. I want to assure you that I'm here to listen without judgment and provide support to the best of my abilities. I'm not expecting you to open up to me right away, but I want you to know that I'm willing to take the time to build trust with you. Can we start by taking small steps towards building that trust? Maybe we can begin with something simple, like sharing a little bit about your day or what's been on your mind lately. Nothing too deep or personal, just something to help us get to know each other a bit better. What do you think?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I don't know, it's just that I've been hurt so many times before. I don't know if I can trust you or anyone else for that matter.</div>

                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Wendy, I can feel how heavy and painful this sense of mistrust is for you. It's like you're carrying a huge weight on your shoulders, and it's making it hard for you to even consider trusting someone new. I want you to know that I'm here to listen without judgment, and I'm not looking to fix you or tell you what to do. I just want to understand you, and be present with you in this moment. Can we take a deep breath together, and just sit with this feeling of mistrust for a moment? Sometimes, just acknowledging and accepting our emotions can be a powerful step towards healing. What do you think?</div>
