                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Hello, Brian. It's nice to meet you. How are you feeling today?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I feel like my anxiety is mostly tied to my students' performance. When they don't do well, I can't help but think it's because I'm failing as a teacher.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>That sounds like a significant source of stress for you. Can you tell me more about what goes through your mind when you're thinking about your students' performance? What are some of the thoughts that make you feel like you're failing as a teacher?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah, it's like I'm constantly replaying all the things I could've done differently in those exams, and I start to feel like I'm just not cut out for this job. I mean, what if I'm just not good enough? What if I'm not worth the students' time?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're having a lot of self-doubt and criticism towards yourself. It's like you're replaying a tape in your head, replaying all the things you could've done differently. Can you tell me more about what's driving this self-doubt? Is it something that's been going on for a while, or is it more related to a specific event or situation?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah, it's hard to pinpoint exactly when it started, but I think it's been building up over the past year or so. It's like a gradual erosion of my confidence, and it feels like it's getting harder to deal with.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like your self-doubt and criticism have been building up gradually over time, and it's affecting your confidence. Can you think of any specific situations or experiences that might have contributed to this erosion of confidence? Was there a particular event or interaction with a student or colleague that stood out to you?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>It's funny, I remember when one of my students didn't do well in an exam, it was like a punch to the gut. I kept thinking about all the things I could've done differently, and it just spiraled out of control. After that, every time a student didn't do well, I'd replay that same scenario in my head, and it just reinforced this feeling of inadequacy.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like that one experience had a significant impact on you and has been influencing your thoughts and feelings about your teaching ability since then. Can you tell me more about what you think about when you replay that scenario in your head? What are some of the thoughts and emotions that come up for you when you think about that student and that exam?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah, it's like I'm constantly replaying all the things I could've done differently in those exams, and I start to feel like I'm just not cut out for this job. I mean, what if I'm just not good enough? What if I'm not worth the students' time?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like that student's performance has really stuck with you and has become a source of self-doubt and criticism. Can you explore with me what you think the student's performance had to do with your worth as a teacher? Is it like you're taking their results personally, or is there something else at play here?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I don't know, it's just hard for me to separate myself from their performance. It feels like their grade is a reflection of my teaching abilities, and if they don't do well, it means I'm not doing my job right. I guess I'm just struggling to see the difference between my teaching and their learning.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're experiencing a lot of emotional pain and self-doubt, and it's affecting your confidence as a teacher. It's understandable that you feel a strong connection between your students' performance and your teaching abilities, but it's also important to recognize that their learning is a complex process that involves many factors beyond your control. Can you think of any ways in which you might be able to shift your focus away from your students' grades and towards their growth and development as learners?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>It's hard for me to imagine doing that because, in my mind, their grades are a direct reflection of my teaching skills. I feel like if I'm not pushing them to do well, I'm not doing my job as a teacher.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're operating under the assumption that your students' success is directly tied to your teaching methods and ability. While it's natural to want to take ownership of your students' learning, it's important to recognize that there are many factors that influence their achievement, including their prior knowledge, learning styles, and outside influences. Can you think of any ways in which you might be able to acknowledge and accommodate these variables, rather than putting all the weight on your own performance?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>It's like I'm trapped in this cycle of self-doubt and criticism, and I'm not sure how to break free. I feel like I'm constantly replaying those negative thoughts in my head, and it's hard to shake them off. I'm worried that if I don't figure out a way to manage this, I'll end up burning out or losing my passion for teaching.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're feeling really stuck and trapped in this cycle of self-doubt and criticism. It's like you're replaying those negative thoughts over and over in your head, and it's hard to shake them off. Can you think of any ways in which you might be able to challenge those thoughts or find a way to reframe them in a more positive or constructive way? Maybe we can explore some strategies together for how you can start to break free from this cycle and find more peace and confidence in your teaching.</div>

                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're really struggling with the idea that your students' grades might not be entirely within your control, and that's making it hard for you to separate your self-worth from their performance. Can you think of any ways in which you might be able to redefine what success means to you as a teacher, beyond just students' grades or test scores? Maybe we can explore some ways to help you focus on the things that are within your control, and find ways to measure your success that feel more meaningful and fulfilling to you.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think I'm struggling to redefine what success means to me as a teacher because I've always defined it by my students' grades. I feel like if I'm not pushing them to do well, I'm not doing my job as a teacher. It's hard for me to imagine doing things differently, but I'm willing to explore this idea of redefining success with you.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're willing to consider a new approach to measuring success as a teacher, one that goes beyond just students' grades or test scores. That takes a lot of courage and openness to new ideas. Can you tell me more about what you think would need to happen for you to feel comfortable with this redefinition of success? What would you need to feel confident that you're being a successful teacher?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>It's funny, I think part of the problem is that I've always defined my success as a teacher by my students' grades, so I feel like I need to be able to show them that I can get them to achieve a certain level of proficiency. But what if I'm not good at that? What if I'm just not cut out for this job?</div>

Can we start by brainstorming some potential ways to measure success as a teacher that have nothing to do with students' grades or test scores? What are some things that you value about teaching, or things that you've always wanted to focus on but never had the chance?
