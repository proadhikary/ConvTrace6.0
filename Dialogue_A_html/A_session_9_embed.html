                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Hi Jennifer, I'm glad you decided to come in today. How are you feeling?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Iâ€™ve been really stressed and feeling completely inadequate at my job.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>I'm so sorry to hear that you're feeling that way, Jennifer. It sounds like you're really struggling with some significant stress and self-doubt. Can you tell me a bit more about what's been going on at work that's causing you to feel this way?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>It's just this one incident with the dog that keeps replaying in my head, and I can't seem to shake the feeling that I'm not good enough as a veterinarian. Even the thought of going to work tomorrow makes me anxious.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Ah, I see. It sounds like this incident with the dog has had a really strong impact on you. It's like it's stuck in your head and you're replaying it over and over again. Can you tell me more about what happened with the dog? What was going on in that moment that's causing you so much distress?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah, it was a really tough case. The dog was in bad shape, and I didn't do enough to save it. I keep thinking about all the things I could have done differently, and it just eats away at me.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like this incident has really triggered some strong feelings of guilt and regret in you, Jennifer. It's like you're replaying the what-ifs and thinking about all the things you could have done differently. Can you tell me more about what you're thinking about when you replay this incident in your head? Are you beating yourself up over specific decisions you made or actions you took during the procedure?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah, it's like I'm constantly replaying the whole thing in my head, thinking about all the mistakes I made and how I could have done it better. And it's not just the specific actions, it's the feeling that I'm just not cut out for this job, that I'm not good enough to be a veterinarian.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're really hard on yourself when it comes to this incident, Jennifer. It's like you're holding yourself to an impossible standard and beating yourself up over perceived mistakes. Can you help me understand what you think would happen if you were to let go of some of this self-criticism and focus on what you did well in that moment? What would that even look like for you?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>It's hard for me to imagine doing that because it feels like I'd be ignoring the fact that I didn't do enough to save the dog. It's like I'd be pretending that everything is okay when it's really not.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're struggling to reconcile the idea of 'doing enough' with the reality of the outcome. It's understandable that you're grappling with this. Can you help me understand what would happen if, instead of focusing on what you didn't do, you were to shift your attention to what you did do? What are some specific actions or decisions you made during the procedure that you can acknowledge and appreciate?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>It's hard for me to even think about what I did well, because it's overshadowed by the feeling that I failed. I guess what I did well was trying to save the dog's life, even if I didn't succeed. But it's hard for me to feel good about that when the outcome was so bad.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're really stuck on the outcome, Jennifer. You're focusing on what didn't happen, rather than what did. I want to gently challenge that for a moment. What if, instead of beating yourself up over what you didn't do, you were to acknowledge that you did try to save the dog's life? That's a remarkable effort, and it takes a lot of courage to do what you did. Can you let that sink in for a moment? What would it feel like if you were to give yourself permission to acknowledge that effort, rather than getting stuck on the outcome?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah, it's hard for me to imagine doing that because it feels like I'd be ignoring the fact that I didn't do enough to save the dog. It's like I'd be pretending that everything is okay when it's really not.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like this incident has really shaken your confidence and self-image as a veterinarian, Jennifer. You're caught between the desire to acknowledge your efforts and the reality of the outcome. I'm not asking you to ignore or dismiss the fact that the dog didn't survive, but rather to consider the complexity of your experience. You didn't just 'try' to save the dog's life, you actually took action and made decisions to do so. That takes a lot of skill, knowledge, and courage. Would you be willing to explore with me what it would mean to acknowledge and honor that effort, rather than letting the outcome define your self-worth?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think I'm just really stuck on the idea that I didn't do enough, and it's hard for me to imagine moving past that feeling. It feels like if I acknowledge my efforts, I'm somehow diminishing the importance of the dog's life.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like there's a deep sense of responsibility and compassion for the dog's life that's driving your feelings of inadequacy, Jennifer. It's like you're carrying a heavy burden of guilt and regret. I want to acknowledge that it's a normal and natural response to feel this way. But I also want to gently suggest that carrying this burden alone might not be sustainable for you. Would you be open to exploring ways to process this experience and your feelings about it in a way that honors both the dog's life and your own efforts as a veterinarian? Maybe we can find a way to acknowledge the complexity of your experience and find a path forward that acknowledges your humanity and your professionalism?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I'm not sure what to make of what you're saying, it's hard for me to imagine acknowledging my efforts when I feel like I didn't do enough to save the dog. It feels like I'd be dismissing the dog's life, and that's not something I can do.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're really grappling with the weight of responsibility and guilt, Jennifer. It's like you're carrying a heavy burden of regret and wondering how you could have done things differently. I want to acknowledge that it's a normal and natural response to feel this way. It's clear that you're deeply invested in the well-being of the animals in your care, and that's an important part of who you are as a veterinarian.

Every time I think about that dog, I feel like I'm reliving the whole experience all over again, and it's hard for me to imagine moving forward without acknowledging my own failures.</div>
