                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Hi Charles, it's nice to meet you. How are you feeling today?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Honestly, I'm feeling pretty down about my writing. I just can't shake off this belief that I'm not good enough, no matter what I do.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Can you tell me more about what's going on with your writing that's making you feel like you're not good enough? Is it the feedback you're getting from others or is it your own self-criticism that's causing you to feel this way?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>To be honest, it's a mix of both. When I receive feedback, I always focus on the negative comments and let them consume me. And even when I try to write something, I'm always self-critiquing, thinking that it's not good enough, that I'm just pretending to be a writer. It's like I'm waiting for someone to expose me as a fraud.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're experiencing a lot of self-doubt and vulnerability around your writing. It's like you're carrying around this weight of uncertainty and inadequacy. Can you help me understand what you think would happen if someone were to expose you as a fraud? What would that look like for you?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>It would be catastrophic, I think. I would feel like I've been living a lie, like I've been fooling everyone, including myself. I would probably lose all sense of purpose and identity. I've always defined myself as a writer, and if that's not true, then who am I?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like the fear of being exposed as a fraud is deeply tied to your sense of self-worth and identity. It's as if you've invested so much of yourself in being a writer that if that's taken away, you'd lose a part of yourself. Can you explore with me what would happen if, instead of being exposed as a fraud, you were to be acknowledged and validated as a writer? What would that look like for you?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>That's a really tough one. I think it would be amazing to be acknowledged and validated as a writer, but I'm not sure I believe that's possible. It's hard for me to let go of the fear that I'm just pretending to be something I'm not. I've built my entire identity around being a writer, and if that's not real, then who am I?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're struggling to separate your sense of self-worth from your writing, and that's making it hard for you to fully embrace your identity as a writer. Can you help me understand what would happen if you were to take a step back and distinguish between your writing abilities and your worth as a person? What if you're not just a writer, but a person with their own unique strengths, weaknesses, and qualities that have nothing to do with your writing?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think it's really hard for me to let go of the idea that my writing abilities define me as a person. It's like, if I'm not a good writer, then what am I? I feel like I've been living this lie, and if I'm not good at something, then I must be bad at everything. It's like I'm stuck in this cycle of self-doubt and fear of being exposed as a fraud.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're carrying around a heavy burden of self-doubt and fear of not being good enough, which is deeply tied to your identity as a writer. It's as if you've defined yourself solely through your writing abilities, and if that's not up to par, then you feel like you're not a worthwhile person. I want to gently challenge that idea by asking, what if you're not just a writer, but a person with their own unique qualities, strengths, and weaknesses that have nothing to do with your writing? What if you're kind, compassionate, funny, or a good friend, for example? How might that change your perspective on yourself and your writing?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I'm not sure, I've never really thought about it that way. I guess I've always defined myself as a writer and that's been hard for me to separate from the rest of my identity.</div>

                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I'm starting to see what you mean. I think I have been defining myself solely as a writer and that's been hard for me to separate from the rest of my identity. It's like I've been living this narrow definition of myself, and if that's not true, then who am I? But what if I'm more than just a writer? What if I'm a complex person with many different facets and qualities? That thought is both exciting and terrifying for me.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're starting to uncover a deeper sense of self that goes beyond your writing abilities. It's natural to feel a mix of emotions about this, as it requires a shift in how you see yourself and your identity. Can you explore with me what it would mean for you to embrace this complex, multi-faceted self, and what kind of freedom or possibilities might come from not defining yourself solely as a writer?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think I'm starting to realize that I've been putting an awful lot of pressure on myself to be a real writer, and that's led me to feel like I'm not good enough. But what if I'm not just a writer, but a person with my own strengths and weaknesses, and my writing is just one part of that? That thought is both exciting and terrifying for me, because it means I have to let go of this idea that I'm a fraud and start seeing myself as a complex, multi-faceted person. I'm not sure what that would look like, but I'm willing to explore it if it means I can finally feel like I'm good enough.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're feeling a sense of liberation and openness to exploring a new sense of self that goes beyond your writing abilities. Can you help me understand what would happen if you were to let go of the need to be a real writer and instead focus on what brings you joy and fulfillment in your life? What if your writing is just one aspect of who you are, and not the defining feature of your identity?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think I've been so focused on trying to prove myself as a writer that I've neglected other aspects of my life that bring me joy. When I started writing, it was a way for me to express myself and connect with others, but over time, it's become this all-consuming goal that's taken over my identity. I'm starting to realize that I don't have to be a real writer to be a good person, and that's a scary but liberating thought.</div>
