                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Welcome, Georgia. How are you feeling today?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Iâ€™m alright, I guess. Not sure what to expect from all this.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Can you tell me a bit more about what's been on your mind lately that's made you feel like you need some support?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Honestly, I'm just feeling really frustrated and disappointed with my cycling performance. I thought I was making progress, but after that last event, I just can't shake the feeling that I'm not good enough. It's like no matter how hard I try, I'm always going to fall short.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're really struggling with self-doubt and frustration right now, and it's impacting your confidence in your cycling abilities. Can you help me understand what happened during that last event that's really stuck with you and contributed to these feelings?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah, it was tough. I had a bad crash during the event and ended up with some minor injuries. But even before that, I just didn't feel like I was performing as well as I could. I was struggling to keep up with the other riders and felt like I was going backwards. That just added to my frustration and self-doubt, making me feel like I'm not good enough to compete at this level.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like the crash and the feeling of not performing up to par really amplified your self-doubt and frustration. Can you tell me more about what went through your mind during that moment when you were crashing? Was there anything specific that stood out to you or anything that you're worried about in terms of the injuries?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah, it was a pretty intense moment. I remember thinking, This is it, I'm never going to be able to compete again, I'm just not good enough... and then I started replaying all the times I had failed in the past, and it just felt like the whole thing was spiraling out of control. I'm still trying to process it, to be honest.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like the crash and the feelings of not performing well were a perfect storm for your self-doubt and frustration. It's understandable that your mind started racing with worst-case scenarios and replaying past failures. It's like your brain was trying to make sense of the situation by recalling similar experiences. Can you tell me more about what you mean by it's still trying to process it? What are some of the emotions that are coming up for you as you try to make sense of what happened?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I don't know, it's just hard to shake the feeling that I'm not good enough. Even when I try to focus on my training, I can't help but think about all the things I've done wrong in the past and how I'll never be able to overcome them. It's like I'm stuck in this never-ending cycle of self-doubt and frustration. And it's not just during training either, it's affecting my daily life too. I've started to withdraw from my friends who share my passion for cycling because I feel like I'm a disappointment to them. I just feel so defeated and hopeless. I don't know how to break free from this rut.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like the crash and the subsequent feelings of self-doubt and frustration have had a profound impact on your daily life, affecting not only your training but also your relationships and overall sense of self-worth. Can you help me understand what you mean by I'm a disappointment to them? Are you worried about how your friends will react to your struggles, or are you concerned that you're not living up to their expectations?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think it's just that I feel like I'm letting them down by not being able to perform as well as I should. I know they're all trying to support me, but it's hard for me to accept that they're still friends with me even though I'm not doing as well as I thought I would. It's like I'm stuck in this feeling of not being good enough, not just for myself, but for everyone else too.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're carrying a heavy burden of self-doubt and frustration, not just in your cycling performance, but also in your relationships. It's like you're worried that everyone will see you as a failure, and that's hard to live with. Can you help me understand what you think would happen if you were to let go of this need to be perfect and accepted by others? Would you feel like you're still worthy of their friendship and respect, even if you're not performing at your best?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I don't know, it's just hard to imagine a life where I'm not constantly thinking about how I'm not good enough. It feels like that's all I've ever been told, and it's hard to shake the feeling that I'm just not worthy of love and acceptance unless I'm perfect.</div>
