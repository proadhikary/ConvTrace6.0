                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Good afternoon, Evelyn. How are you feeling today?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I've been trying to keep myself busy with other activities, but the anxiety about my garden keeps creeping back in. I know it's just plants, but it feels like a much bigger issue.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Can you tell me more about what specifically is causing you distress about your garden? Is it the fear of losing the plants, the worry about not being able to care for them properly, or is it something else entirely?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Ah, yes! I think it's mostly the fear of losing the plants. When I see one of them struggling, my mind starts racing with all the worst-case scenarios. I imagine all my plants dying, and it's like a snowball effect - one plant's problems become a sign of a much bigger issue with my entire garden. It's like my brain is convinced that if I don't fix one plant, the whole garden will collapse.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like the fear of loss and the perceived importance of your garden are really amplifying your anxiety. Can you help me understand what's behind this sense of responsibility you feel towards your plants? Is it a sense of control, a desire to be a good caretaker, or is there something else driving this need to keep everything perfect in your garden?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>That's a great question, and I think it's a mix of everything you mentioned. As a single parent, I've always tried to be responsible and provide for my child, and I think that sense of responsibility has carried over into my gardening. I feel like my garden is my way of showing my child that I care about them and can provide for them, even when they're grown and moved out.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like your gardening has taken on a deeper significance as a way to demonstrate your love and provision for your child, even as they become more independent. This sense of responsibility and provision can be a powerful motivator for you, but it's also creating a significant amount of anxiety. Can you tell me more about what you hope to achieve by having a perfect garden, and what would happen if your garden didn't meet your expectations?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Ah, yes, I see what you're getting at. I think I'm hoping to achieve a sense of pride and accomplishment through having a perfect garden, but deep down, I'm also seeking validation and recognition as a good parent. If my garden didn't meet my expectations, I think I would feel like I've failed not only myself but also my child. It's like I'm trying to prove to myself and others that I'm a capable and responsible parent, and my garden has become a symbol of that.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like your gardening has become a way for you to prove to yourself and others that you're a capable and responsible parent, which is understandable given your role as a single parent. But it's also creating a lot of pressure and anxiety for you. Can you imagine what would happen if you were to let go of the need for a perfect garden and instead focus on nurturing your plants and enjoying the process of gardening, without the added burden of meeting expectations? How might that change your relationship with your garden and your sense of identity as a parent?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think letting go of the need for a perfect garden would be incredibly liberating. I would no longer be tied to this constant worry and anxiety about my plants, and I could focus on the joy and beauty of gardening instead. It would be like a weight has been lifted off my shoulders.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're already beginning to envision a more peaceful and enjoyable relationship with your garden, where you can focus on the process rather than the outcome. That's a really powerful insight. I'd like to explore this idea further with you. What do you think would be the first step in letting go of the need for a perfect garden? Would it be acknowledging that it's okay for your plants to not be perfect, or would it be making a conscious decision to prioritize your own well-being over the need for a perfect garden?</div>

                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think that's a really good point, counselor.

                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think that's a really valuable insight, counselor. It's clear that my need for a perfect garden is deeply tied to my sense of identity and responsibility as a parent. By acknowledging that it's okay for my plants to not be perfect, I'm already starting to see that I don't have to tie my self-worth to the success of my garden. This realization is both empowering and terrifying at the same time.</div>

I could focus on the beauty of the plants, the smell of the soil, and the satisfaction of watching them grow, without the added burden of meeting expectations. It's a really exciting prospect, and I'm looking forward to exploring this idea further in our next session.</div>

I've never really thought about it that way before, but now that you mention it, it makes sense. I do feel like my parenting identity is closely tied to my garden, and that's what makes it so hard for me to let go of the need for a perfect garden. But what if I could separate those two and just enjoy the process of gardening without worrying about what others think or how it reflects on me as a parent? That's a really empowering idea, and I'm excited to explore it further in our next session.</div>
