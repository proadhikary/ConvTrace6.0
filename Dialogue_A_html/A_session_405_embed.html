                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Hi Tyler, I'm glad you're here today. Could you start by telling me a bit about what's been bothering you?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I've realized that my reaction to losing that pool game has been pretty extreme. I know it's just a game, but for some reason, it felt like a much bigger deal. Now, I'm avoiding playing pool altogether because I'm afraid of feeling that way again.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Tyler, it sounds like this loss has really stuck with you and has led to some changes in your behavior. Can you help me understand what was going through your mind during and right after the game that made it feel like a bigger deal? Was it the way you were playing, or was it something your opponent did that got to you?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Ah, yeah, I think it was a combination of things. I was having a pretty good game going, and then I started to lose focus and made a few mistakes. My opponent was also playing really well, and it felt like they were getting ahead of me quickly. But I think what really got to me was the way my friends reacted to my loss. They were all pretty excited and cheering for my opponent, and it felt like they were rubbing it in my face.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like the loss was not just about the game itself, but also about how you felt like you were being perceived by your friends. It's like you felt like you let them down or didn't live up to their expectations. Can you help me understand what that feels like for you? What's going through your mind when you think about your friends reacting that way?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah, it's like I felt like I was a disappointment to them, and that they were expecting me to do better. It's hard for me to accept that they can be happy for someone else's win without me feeling like I've lost something. It's like I'm constantly comparing myself to others and feeling like I'm not good enough.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're experiencing a sense of self-doubt and inadequacy, and that this feeling is deeply connected to how your friends react to your losses. It's as if you're constantly seeking validation from them, and when you don't get it, you feel like you're not good enough. Can you tell me more about what you mean by I'm constantly comparing myself to others and feeling like I'm not good enough? What specific thoughts go through your mind when you're in these situations?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>That's a really good point, counselor. I think what I'm trying to say is that I always feel like I need to be better than everyone else, whether it's in a game, in my art, or even in just being a good friend. I feel like if I'm not the best, I'm not good enough. It's like I'm constantly striving for perfection, and when I don't reach it, I feel like I've failed. I know it's not healthy, but it's hard for me to shake off that feeling of not being good enough.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're carrying a heavy burden of self-expectation, Tyler. It's like you're constantly trying to meet this perfect standard, and when you don't, you feel like you've let yourself down. Can you help me understand where this need for perfection comes from? Is there something or someone in your past that has influenced this way of thinking?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>That's a great question, counselor. I think it might be related to my parents' divorce. They're both really competitive and always put a lot of pressure on me to be the best. My mom is an artist, and my dad is a musician, and they both have high standards for themselves and for me. I think I've just internalized that pressure and taken it upon myself to be perfect in everything I do. Even when I was a kid, they would praise me when I did something well and criticize me when I didn't, and I think that's stuck with me.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Tyler, it sounds like your parents' high expectations and competitive nature have had a profound impact on your self-perception and drive for perfection. It's as if you've taken on the responsibility of meeting their standards, and when you don't, you feel like you've failed not just yourself, but also them. Can you help me understand how their divorce has affected you? How did you feel about your parents' breakup, and do you think it's contributed to your need for perfection and fear of failure?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah, their divorce was really tough on me. I was just a kid at the time, and I didn't understand why they couldn't just work things out. I felt like I was the one who had failed, like I wasn't good enough to keep them together. Even though they've since told me that it wasn't my fault, I still feel like I was somehow responsible. I think that's why I've always felt like I need to be perfect, like if I'm not perfect, I'll lose people I care about.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Tyler, it sounds like your parents' divorce has left a deep scar on your psyche, and you've internalized the pressure and expectations they placed on you. It's like you're carrying around this weight of responsibility, believing that if you're not perfect, you'll lose people or fail to meet their standards. Can you help me understand how this has affected your sense of identity and self-worth? Do you feel like you're living up to your own expectations, or are you constantly struggling to meet the standards of others?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>That's a really good point, counselor. I think what I'm trying to say is that I always feel like I need to be better than everyone else, whether it's in a game, in my art, or even in just being a good friend.

                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're carrying a heavy burden of self-expectation, Tyler. It's like you're constantly trying to meet this perfect standard, and when you don't, you feel like you've let yourself down. I want to acknowledge that it takes a lot of courage to admit this, and it's clear that you're struggling to live up to your own expectations. Can you help me understand what you think would happen if you didn't strive for perfection? Would you feel like you're not good enough, or would you be able to let go of that need for perfection and just be yourself?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think if I didn't strive for perfection, I would feel anxious and uncertain about my abilities. It's like I've always relied on being good enough to feel secure and validated. But at the same time, I can see how this constant need for perfection is holding me back and making me feel like I'm not good enough. It's like I'm trapped in this cycle of self-doubt and fear of failure.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Can you help me understand what you think would happen if you didn't strive for perfection?

                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think if I didn't strive for perfection, I would feel a sense of uncertainty and anxiety about my abilities, but I also think I would be able to let go of that need for perfection and just be myself. It's like I'm trying to prove to myself and others that I'm good enough, but in doing so, I'm actually preventing myself from being happy and fulfilled. If I could just embrace my imperfections and flaws, I think I would feel more at peace and confident in who I am.</div>

                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>It's interesting to me that I've been so focused on being perfect and meeting others' expectations, but when I'm not perfect, I actually feel more anxious and uncertain about my abilities.

                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think embracing my imperfections and flaws would mean accepting that I'm not perfect and that it's okay to make mistakes. It would mean letting go of the need to be the best and striving for perfection in every aspect of my life.
