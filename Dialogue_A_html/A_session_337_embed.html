                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Hello, Riley. Welcome to the session. How are you feeling today?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I've just been struggling a lot with finding meaning in what I do. It's been hard to stay motivated, and I feel like I'm not making any real progress.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Can you tell me more about what you mean by finding meaning in what you do? What are some specific tasks or activities that feel unfulfilling to you, and how have you typically tried to stay motivated in the past?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah, I guess it's just that I feel like I'm just going through the motions with my athletic career. I used to love playing, but now it just feels like a chore. I don't feel like I'm achieving anything meaningful, and that's really taking a toll on my motivation.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Can you help me understand what you mean by achieving something meaningful in your athletic career? Is it about winning competitions, setting personal records, or something else entirely? And have you noticed any changes in your behavior or routines that might be contributing to feeling like you're just going through the motions?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah, I mean, I used to love competing and pushing myself to be the best I could be, but now it just feels like I'm just doing it because it's expected of me. I don't feel like I'm doing it for myself anymore. And as for changes in my behavior or routines, I've been noticing that I've been consistently comparing myself to others who have already pursued their dreams of exploration. That comparison really takes a toll on my motivation and overall well-being.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're feeling a sense of disconnection from your athletic career, like you're not doing it for yourself anymore, but rather because of external expectations. And comparing yourself to others who have already achieved their goals can be really tough. Can you tell me more about what you mean by doing it for yourself? What would that look like for you, and how do you think that would impact your motivation and overall satisfaction with your athletic career?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think doing it for myself would mean finding a sense of purpose and fulfillment in my athletic career. It would mean being able to say that I'm doing it because I love it, not just because I'm expected to. And I think that would be a huge motivator for me, because I would be doing it for myself, not for anyone else.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like finding purpose and fulfillment in your athletic career is closely tied to your sense of autonomy and self-motivation. Can you explore with me what specific things you would need to feel like you're doing it for yourself? Would it be setting your own goals, taking on new challenges, or finding a different coaching style that resonates with you? What are some small steps you could take to start moving towards feeling more autonomous and purposeful in your athletic career?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think it would be helpful to start by setting my own goals that are meaningful to me, rather than just following the expectations of my coaches or teammates. Maybe I could start by setting some short-term goals that align with my values and interests, and then work towards those goals. That might help me feel more in control and motivated.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like setting your own goals could be a powerful way for you to feel more connected to your athletic career and motivated to make progress. Can you help me understand what kind of short-term goals you might set for yourself, and how you would go about achieving them? What kind of support system would you need to have in place to help you stay on track and motivated towards those goals?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah, that's a great idea. I think setting my own goals would help me feel more in control and motivated. Maybe I could start by setting some short-term goals that align with my values and interests, and then work towards those goals. That might help me feel more connected to my athletic career and motivated to make progress.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you've already had some insight into what might help you feel more connected to your athletic career and motivated to make progress. Setting your own goals that align with your values and interests could be a powerful way for you to take control and feel more autonomous. Can we explore this idea a bit more? What kind of short-term goals might you set for yourself, and how would you go about achieving them? For example, would you need to work with a new coach or training partner, or find ways to make your training more enjoyable or engaging?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah, I think setting my own goals would be a great way to start taking control of my athletic career again. I would need to start by identifying what's truly important to me and what I want to achieve. Maybe I could start by setting some short-term goals that align with my values and interests, like improving my technique or setting a new personal record. I would need to work with my coach to create a plan that aligns with my goals and provides the support I need to achieve them.</div>

                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think it's interesting that we've been focusing on my athletic career, but I also feel like my desire to explore and travel is a big part of what's missing for me.

I've been feeling stuck in my current situation, and it's hard not to compare myself to others who have already done what I want to do. Maybe I could start by saving up money each month, and then use that money to plan a small trip or weekend getaway. That would give me something to look forward to and help me feel more in control. I could also start researching different destinations and reading travel blogs to get inspiration and ideas.</div>
