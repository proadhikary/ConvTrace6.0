                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Hi Gina, it's nice to meet you. How are you feeling today?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I'm feeling pretty down about myself lately. The incident during the rehearsals has really shaken my confidence, and I can't seem to get past it.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>I'm so sorry to hear that, Gina. It sounds like this incident has really had a significant impact on you. Can you tell me more about what happened during the rehearsals and how it's been affecting you since then?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah, it's just been really tough. I feel like I'm not good enough, and that dancer is always on my mind. I try to focus on my performance, but I just can't shake this feeling that I'm a failure.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>I can sense the weight of this feeling of not being good enough, Gina. It sounds like it's not just about the incident itself, but also about the self-doubt that's creeping in. Can you help me understand what you mean by 'that dancer' and what specifically is going through your mind when you think about them?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Honestly, it's just hard for me to separate my emotions from the fact that they're a part of my team. Every time I see them, I think about how they could have been more careful, how they could have prevented the accident. It's like they're a constant reminder of my failure, and it's hard for me to focus on my own performance when I'm thinking about what could have been done differently.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're carrying a lot of responsibility and guilt around this incident, Gina. It's like you're feeling that you could have prevented it from happening, or that you should have done something differently. Can you help me understand what you mean by 'they could have been more careful'? What specific actions do you think they could have taken to prevent the accident?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>It's hard for me to think that they could have done something differently, because I know we were both training together and we didn't have any issues before the incident. It's like, if they had been more careful, maybe I wouldn't have gotten hurt. But at the same time, I know accidents can happen, and it's not like they intentionally tried to hurt me. It's just really frustrating because I feel like I'm stuck in this cycle of self-blame and guilt, and I don't know how to get out of it.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Gina, it sounds like you're carrying a lot of weight on your shoulders, not just physically from the injury, but also emotionally from the guilt and self-blame. It's understandable that you're feeling stuck in this cycle. Can you help me understand what you think would happen if you were able to let go of some of this guilt and self-blame? What would that look like for you, and what would you hope to gain from it?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>It's hard for me to imagine what that would look like, because I feel like I've been carrying this guilt and self-blame for so long that it's become a part of who I am. I don't know if I'd even know how to be without it.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Gina, it sounds like you're deeply entangled with this guilt and self-blame, and it's hard for you to imagine a life without it. That's a really tough place to be. Can you tell me more about what you mean by it's become a part of who I am? What does that look like for you, and how do you think it affects your daily life and relationships?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah, it's like I've built this whole identity around being a failure and being responsible for the accident, and I don't know how to break free from that. It's like I'm trapped in this cycle of self-blame and guilt, and I don't see a way out.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're feeling really stuck, Gina, and like this identity you've built around being a failure is holding you back from moving forward. Can you help me understand what you think would happen if you were to challenge this identity and start to see yourself in a different light? What would that look like for you, and what would you hope to gain from it?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I'm not sure, it's hard for me to even imagine being someone who isn't defined by this accident and my perceived failure. I feel like if I were to challenge this identity, I'd be lying to myself and others, and that's scary. I'm not sure I'm ready to let go of this guilt and self-blame, it's become so ingrained in me that I don't know who I would be without it.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Gina, it sounds like you're deeply afraid of losing this identity, even though it's causing you so much pain and holding you back. It's understandable that it's scary to consider letting go of something that's been a part of you for so long. Can you help me understand what you think would happen if you were to take small steps towards challenging this identity, rather than trying to do it all at once? What would that look like for you, and what would you hope to gain from it?</div>

I want to acknowledge that it's understandable that it's scary to consider letting go of something that's been a part of you for so long. Before we move forward, I want to make sure you feel heard and understood. Can you tell me more about what it would mean to you to challenge this identity and take small steps towards letting go of this guilt and self-blame? What would it mean to you to start seeing yourself in a different light, and what would you hope to gain from it?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>It's hard for me to even imagine letting go of this guilt and self-blame because it's become such a big part of my identity. I feel like I've been carrying this weight around for so long that it's hard to see a way out. I'm scared of losing this sense of responsibility and feeling like I'm not doing anything to make up for what happened. It's like I'm stuck in this cycle of self-blame and guilt, and I don't know how to break free from it.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Gina, it sounds like you're feeling really stuck and trapped in this cycle of self-blame and guilt. I want to acknowledge that it's understandable that you're scared to let go of this identity, especially if it's been a part of you for so long. But I also want to gently challenge you to consider that maybe this identity isn't serving you well. Maybe it's actually holding you back from moving forward and finding a sense of peace and closure. I'm not suggesting that you forget what happened or that you're not responsible for your actions, but maybe it's time to consider that you don't have to define yourself solely by this incident. What do you think would happen if you were to take small steps towards challenging this identity and exploring a new sense of self that's not tied to guilt and self-blame?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>It's hard for me to imagine taking small steps towards challenging this identity, because it feels like it would be a huge betrayal of myself and others. I'm scared that if I let go of this guilt and self-blame, I'll be seen as abandoning my responsibility and not taking accountability for what happened. I don't know how to reconcile this with my values of being a good person and taking responsibility for my actions.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Gina, it sounds like you're deeply entangled with this idea of responsibility and accountability, and you're worried that letting go of this guilt and self-blame would mean you're not taking responsibility for what happened. I want to acknowledge that it's understandable that you're concerned about your values and how you'll be perceived by others. Can you help me understand what you mean by being a good person and how you think taking responsibility for your actions is tied to that? Is it possible that being a good person doesn't have to mean carrying around this weight of guilt and self-blame?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think being a good person means taking responsibility for my actions, even if they're not perfect. But I'm not sure if that means I have to carry around this guilt and self-blame for the rest of my life. It's like, I know I made a mistake, but I don't think that mistake defines me as a person. Maybe being a good person is more about learning from my mistakes and moving forward, rather than dwelling on them.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Gina, it sounds like you're really struggling with the idea of letting go of this guilt and self-blame, and it's understandable that you're worried about what it would mean for your sense of responsibility and accountability. I want to gently challenge you to consider that maybe being a good person isn't solely about taking responsibility for your actions, but also about learning from those mistakes and being willing to grow and move forward. Can you help me explore what that might look like for you? What would it mean to you to be able to move forward from this incident, without defining yourself solely by it?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think I'm starting to understand that being a good person means more than just carrying around guilt and self-blame.
