                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Hi Courtney, it’s nice to meet you. What brings you in today?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I’ve been feeling really irresponsible and am constantly criticizing myself, especially when it comes to taking care of my cat.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Can you tell me more about what's going on with taking care of your cat that's making you feel irresponsible? What are some specific thoughts that come up for you when you're thinking about it?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Honestly, I don't know why I'm even bothering with this. I'm just going to mess everything up anyway, and I'm not even good enough to take care of my own cat.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're beating yourself up over this, and that can be really overwhelming. Can you help me understand what you mean by 'mess everything up'? What specifically are you worried about happening to your cat?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I don't know, it's just that I always seem to forget to feed it or forget to clean its litter box, and then I feel so guilty and ashamed of myself. I'm just so used to feeling like I'm not capable of doing anything right, and it's like, what's the point even trying?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're putting a lot of pressure on yourself to be perfect when it comes to taking care of your cat, and when you don't meet those high expectations, you feel like a failure. Can you help me understand what's driving this need for perfection? Is there something specific that happened in the past that's making you feel like you're not good enough?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah, I guess I just feel like my parents always expected me to be perfect, and I feel like I've let them down so many times before. And now, I'm just carrying that over to my cat, and it's like, I don't know, I feel like I'm just stuck in this cycle of self-doubt and self-criticism, and I don't know how to break free from it.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like your parents' high expectations and your feelings of not meeting them have had a lasting impact on your self-perception and confidence. Can you help me understand how you think this has affected your relationships with others, not just your parents? For example, have you found yourself putting up with things or accepting less than you deserve because you're so used to feeling like you're not good enough?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I guess I do feel like I've been settling for less than I want in my relationships, just because I don't feel like I'm worthy of anything more. It's like, I'm just waiting for the other shoe to drop and for everyone to realize that I'm not good enough. And it's hard for me to even imagine what it would be like to have a healthy, loving relationship where I don't have to constantly prove myself.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're carrying around a lot of self-doubt and self-criticism from your parents' expectations, and it's affecting not just your relationship with your cat, but also your other relationships. It's like you're waiting for everyone to discover that you're not good enough, and that's making it hard for you to form close, healthy connections with others. Can you tell me more about what that's like, waiting for the other shoe to drop? What do you think would happen if the other shoe didn't drop, if you were actually worthy and good enough just as you are?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah, I guess that's what's so hard for me to accept - that maybe I'm not as bad as I think I am, and that maybe I don't have to be perfect all the time. It's like, I've been living in this perpetual state of self-doubt and self-criticism for so long, I don't know how to even imagine a different reality.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're carrying around a heavy burden of self-doubt and self-criticism, and it's been with you for a long time. It's almost like you're living in a world where you're constantly waiting for the other shoe to drop, and that's making it hard for you to enjoy the present moment and form close connections with others. I want to gently challenge you to consider the possibility that maybe, just maybe, you're not as bad as you think you are. Maybe you're not defined by your mistakes and imperfections. Can you imagine what it would be like to let go of the need for perfection and just be yourself, flaws and all?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I don't know, it's just that I've been living with these negative thoughts for so long, I'm not even sure who I am without them. I feel like I've been so focused on proving myself to others that I've forgotten how to be kind to myself, and I'm not even sure how to start being kind to myself.</div>

                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think I understand what you're saying, but it's hard for me to imagine a reality where I'm not constantly criticized and judged by others, where I don't have to constantly prove myself to be worthy.
