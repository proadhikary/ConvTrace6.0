                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Hi Madelyn, it's good to meet you. How can I support you today?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I've been feeling a lot of despair and uncertainty about my future since I dropped out of college. It's been affecting my mental well-being, especially when I think about my financial stability and career prospects.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Can you tell me more about what led you to drop out of college and what kind of uncertainty are you experiencing about your future? What are some of the specific thoughts or concerns that come up for you when you think about your financial stability and career prospects?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>That's a great question, and I think it's a good place to start. I dropped out of college because I was struggling with the coursework and personal challenges at the time. I felt overwhelmed and like I was failing, and I just couldn't see a way to continue. As for the uncertainty, it's hard to know what the future holds, and it's scary to think about not being able to provide for myself financially. I worry about being able to make ends meet, and I feel like I'm just one step away from financial disaster. When I think about my career prospects, I feel like I've missed out on so many opportunities, and I'm not sure how I'll be able to catch up. I also worry about being able to find a job that aligns with my values and interests.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like dropping out of college was a really difficult and overwhelming experience for you, and it's reasonable that it's had a lasting impact on your sense of uncertainty and fear about your future. Can you help me understand more about what you mean by finding a job that aligns with your values and interests? What are some specific values or interests that you think are important to you, and how have you seen those play out in your past experiences or dreams?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>That's a great question, and I think it's a good place to start. I've always valued independence and financial security, and I'm interested in pursuing a career that allows me to make a positive impact on my community. In the past, I've had experiences in the military that have given me a sense of fulfillment, and I've also been involved in volunteer work that has helped me feel like I'm making a difference. I'm not sure how I'll be able to find a job that combines those values and interests, but I'm hoping that through this counseling process, I'll be able to gain some clarity and direction.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you've had some meaningful experiences in the military and through volunteer work that have given you a sense of fulfillment and purpose. Can you tell me more about what it was about those experiences that resonated with you? What specific aspects of independence, financial security, and making a positive impact on your community do you think are most important to you, and how do you see those values playing out in a potential career or occupation?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think what resonated with me most about my military experiences was the sense of camaraderie and shared purpose that came with serving alongside my fellow soldiers. It was a feeling of being part of something bigger than myself, and it gave me a sense of belonging and identity. As for financial security, I think it's important to me because I've seen how financial stress can affect relationships and overall well-being. And making a positive impact on my community is important to me because I believe that everyone has a role to play in making their community a better place.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like the sense of camaraderie and shared purpose you experienced in the military was a powerful source of fulfillment for you. It's interesting that you mention financial security as an important value, and I sense that there may be some underlying concerns or fears related to not having financial stability. Can you help me understand more about what specifically is driving your desire for financial security? Is it a fear of not being able to take care of yourself, or is it something else entirely?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think my desire for financial security is driven by a fear of not being able to take care of myself and provide for my basic needs. I've seen how financial stress can affect relationships and overall well-being, and I don't want to feel like I'm a burden to others. I also worry about not being able to pursue my passions and interests because of financial limitations. But at the same time, I'm trying to be more mindful of my thoughts and recognize that I'm capable of making smart financial decisions and finding ways to make ends meet. I'm hoping that through this counseling process, I'll be able to work through these fears and develop a more positive relationship with money.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like your desire for financial security is deeply rooted in a desire to feel self-sufficient and capable of taking care of yourself, while also being mindful of not wanting to be a burden to others. Can you help me understand what you mean by not wanting to be a burden to others? What specific concerns or fears do you have about being a burden, and how do you think your financial security might alleviate those concerns?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>You're right, my desire for financial security is deeply rooted in a desire to feel self-sufficient and capable of taking care of myself. I think what's driving this desire is a fear of being a burden to others. I worry that if I'm not financially stable, I'll have to rely on others to support me, and that's a really uncomfortable feeling for me. I've always prided myself on being independent and self-sufficient, and the thought of having to ask for help or rely on others is really scary for me. I think this fear is also tied to my past experiences of feeling overwhelmed and like I was failing when I was in college. I didn't want to be a burden to my family or friends, and I felt like I was putting them out by asking for help. So, in my mind, financial security is a way to alleviate that fear and feel like I'm capable of taking care of myself.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like your desire for financial security is deeply rooted in a desire to feel self-sufficient and capable of taking care of yourself, while also being mindful of not wanting to be a burden to others. Can you help me understand how this fear of being a burden has played out in your past experiences, especially during your time in college? What specific situations or interactions made you feel like you were a burden, and how have you carried that feeling with you since then?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I remember feeling like I was a burden to my family and friends when I was struggling in college. They would offer to help me with my coursework or provide financial support, but I would feel guilty and overwhelmed by their offers. I didn't want to be a burden, so I would often decline their help or try to handle things on my own. This pattern of behavior continued even after I dropped out of college, and I would avoid asking for help or support from others because I felt like I was a burden.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you've been carrying this fear of being a burden with you since your time in college, and it's had a significant impact on your relationships and sense of self-sufficiency. Can you help me understand how you've been trying to cope with this fear so far? What strategies have you used to avoid feeling like a burden, and how have they been working for you?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I've been trying to cope with this fear by avoiding asking for help or support from others, as I mentioned earlier. When I do need help, I try to handle things on my own or find ways to make ends meet without relying on others. This has been working for me in the sense that I've been able to maintain some level of financial stability, but it's also been isolating and stressful. I've been feeling like I'm shouldering the burden alone, and it's been taking a toll on my mental and physical health.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Can you help me understand what you mean by shouldering the burden alone? What does that feel like for you, and how has it been affecting your mental and physical health?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I feel like I'm shouldering the burden alone when I'm trying to handle everything on my own, without asking for help or support from others. It's like I'm carrying a heavy weight on my shoulders, and it's starting to feel like I'm going to collapse under the pressure. This feeling is really overwhelming and stressful for me, and it's been affecting my mental health in that I've been feeling anxious and depressed. Physically, I've been experiencing headaches and insomnia because I'm constantly worrying about how I'm going to make ends meet and provide for myself. It's like I'm living in a state of constant fear and uncertainty, and it's really taking a toll on my overall well-being.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're carrying a heavy load of responsibility and feeling like you're shouldering the burden alone. It's impressive that you've been able to maintain some level of financial stability, but it's also understandable that it's taking a toll on your mental and physical health. Can you help me understand what it would mean for you to be able to share this burden with others, or to feel like you're not alone in this struggle? What would that look like for you, and how do you think it could help alleviate some of the stress and anxiety you're experiencing?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think it would mean a lot for me to be able to share this burden with others, to feel like I'm not alone in this struggle. It would mean being able to ask for help and support without feeling guilty or overwhelmed. It would mean having a sense of community and connection with others who understand what I'm going through. It would mean being able to rely on others and know that I'm not alone in this fight.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like sharing the burden with others would bring a sense of relief and connection to you. It's as if you're carrying a heavy load and feeling like you're alone in this struggle. Can we explore what it would look like to have a support system in place, where you feel comfortable asking for help and support without feeling guilty or overwhelmed? Maybe we can brainstorm some ways to build that support system, whether it's through counseling, group therapy, or even just having a few close friends or family members who understand what you're going through. What do you think about that?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think that would be incredibly helpful. Just being able to talk to someone who understands what I'm going through and can offer support and guidance would make a huge difference. I've been carrying this burden alone for so long, and it's exhausting. I feel like I'm constantly on edge, waiting for something to go wrong or for someone to find out that I'm not doing as well as I seem. It's like I'm living in a state of constant fear and anxiety.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like the weight of responsibility and the fear of being a burden to others has been a heavy burden for you to carry for a long time. It's understandable that you've been trying to handle everything on your own, but it's clear that it's taking a toll on your mental and physical health. I want to acknowledge your strength and resilience in maintaining some level of financial stability, despite the difficulties you've faced. It's clear that you're desperate for a sense of community and connection, and that's something that I'm here to help you with. One thing that might be helpful is to explore what it would look like to have a support system in place, where you feel comfortable asking for help and support without feeling guilty or overwhelmed. We can work on building that support system together, whether it's through counseling, group therapy, or just having a few close friends or family members who understand what you're going through. What do you think about that?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think that sounds like a great idea. I would love to explore ways to build a support system and feel like I'm not alone in this struggle. It's been so isolating and overwhelming trying to handle everything on my own. I'm hoping that through this process, I can learn to ask for help and support without feeling guilty or overwhelmed. I'm also hoping that I can learn to rely on others and know that I'm not alone in this fight.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're carrying a significant amount of emotional weight and feeling like you're shouldering the burden alone. Can you help me understand what it would mean for you to have a sense of community and connection with others who understand what you're going through? What would that look like for you, and how do you think it could help alleviate some of the stress and anxiety you're experiencing?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think having a sense of community and connection with others who understand what I'm going through would mean a lot to me. It would mean being able to share my feelings and experiences with someone who gets it, without feeling like I'm burdening them or being a problem to them. It would mean having someone to turn to when I'm feeling overwhelmed and anxious, and knowing that they're there to support me without judgment. I think that would help alleviate some of the stress and anxiety I'm experiencing, and make me feel more grounded and supported.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It seems like you're feeling a lot of pressure and responsibility to shoulder the burden alone, which is causing you a lot of stress and anxiety. It's understandable that you want to be self-sufficient and independent, but it's also important to recognize that it's okay to ask for help and support when you need it. I want to gently challenge your assumption that you're a burden to others when you ask for help. I think it's possible that others may be willing and able to support you, but they don't know how to help because you're not asking. By keeping your struggles to yourself, you may be depriving yourself of the support and connection you need to feel less alone and more grounded.Can you help me understand what's holding you back from asking for help? Is it fear of rejection, fear of being a burden, or something else entirely?</div>
