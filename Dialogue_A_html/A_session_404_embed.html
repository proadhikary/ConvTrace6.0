                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Hello, Andrew. It’s nice to meet you. How are you feeling today?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I appreciate you asking. I’ve been feeling a lot of self-doubt lately, especially with my cooking. Even when I get positive feedback, it doesn’t seem to help. I’m just not sure how to move past this.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Can you tell me more about what's going on with your cooking and how it's making you feel? What is it about the self-doubt that's particularly troublesome for you?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>It's just that no matter how hard I try, I feel like I'm never good enough. And even when someone tells me I'm doing well, it's like, Yeah, yeah, just wait until they see what I really can't do. It's like, I'm just waiting for the other shoe to drop, you know?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're experiencing a lot of anxiety around your cooking, and that the self-doubt is really pervasive and hard to shake. It's like you're always waiting for something to go wrong. Can you tell me more about what you mean by what I really can't do? What are you worried you'll be unable to do?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah, it's just that I have this constant fear that I'll fail or make a mistake, and people will realize I'm not as good as I thought I was. I feel like I'm living in this constant state of anxiety, wondering when I'll be found out. It's exhausting, to be honest.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're carrying around a lot of weight on your shoulders, always worried about making a mistake and being judged by others. It's like you're living in a state of hypervigilance, always on the lookout for potential failure. Can you tell me more about what you think would happen if you were to make a mistake or fail? What would that look like, and how would that affect your life?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>It's like, I don't know, I just feel like I'll be a total embarrassment, and everyone will be talking about how bad I am. I'll be the laughing stock of the culinary world, and I'll never be able to show my face in public again. It's a constant fear that's always lurking in the back of my mind, making me feel like I'm walking on eggshells all the time.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like the fear of failure is deeply intertwined with your sense of self-worth and identity. It's as if you're carrying around this heavy burden of being perfect, and any mistake would mean that you're not good enough. Can you explore with me what this perfectionism might be rooted in? Is there something or someone that has contributed to this expectation of flawlessness?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah, I guess it all started when my mom passed away. I was really young, and I think I put a lot of pressure on myself to be perfect because I felt like I needed to make her proud. And then, when I got into culinary school, I just got caught up in this idea that I had to be the best, or else I'd never make it in the industry. But even when I do well, it's like it's not enough because I'm always worried about making a mistake.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like your perfectionism and need to be good enough may be deeply rooted in your childhood and your mother's passing. It's as if you're carrying around this heavy burden of being perfect to make up for something that's missing. Can you tell me more about what you think your mom would think about your cooking and your endeavors? What do you imagine she would say to you if she were here today?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah, I guess it's just that I feel like I've been living my whole life trying to make her proud, and even though she's not here, I still feel like I need to be perfect to make up for it. It's like, I'm still trying to prove something to her, even though she's gone.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like your mom's passing has had a profound impact on your sense of self-worth and your drive for perfection. It's as if you're still trying to prove something to her, even though she's no longer with you. Can you explore with me what you think would happen if you were to let go of this need to be perfect and make her proud? What would that look like for you, and how might it affect your relationship with your cooking and with yourself?</div>

                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're carrying around a lot of grief and loss, and that your perfectionism is closely tied to your desire to make your mom proud. It's as if you're still trying to prove something to her, even though she's no longer with you. I want to gently challenge you to consider what would happen if you were to let go of this need to be perfect and make her proud. What would that look like for you, and how might it affect your relationship with your cooking and with yourself?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>It's hard to imagine a life where I'm not constantly striving for perfection, because it's been such a big part of my identity for so long. I'm not sure who I would be without that drive. But at the same time, I'm exhausted from always being on edge, waiting for something to go wrong. I feel like I'm missing out on the joy of cooking because I'm so focused on not making a mistake.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're caught in a cycle of self-doubt, anxiety, and perfectionism that's deeply rooted in your childhood and your mother's passing. You're carrying around a heavy burden of being perfect, and any mistake would mean that you're not good enough. It's like you're living in a state of hypervigilance, always on the lookout for potential failure.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>It's like, I'm stuck in this never-ending cycle of self-doubt and fear, and I don't know how to break free from it. I feel like I'm constantly walking on eggshells, waiting for the other shoe to drop, and it's exhausting.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're feeling really trapped in this cycle of self-doubt and perfectionism, and it's affecting your ability to enjoy cooking and your overall well-being. I want to acknowledge that it takes a lot of courage to share this with me, and I'm here to support you in exploring ways to break free from this cycle. Can you tell me what you think would happen if you were to take a step back and acknowledge that it's okay to make mistakes? What would that look like for you, and how might it affect your relationship with your cooking and with yourself?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I don't know, I just feel like if I were to let go of this need to be perfect, I would be giving up on my mom's memory and everything she wanted for me. It's like, I'm still trying to make her proud, even though she's gone.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're deeply entangled with the idea of making your mom proud, and that this need for perfection is closely tied to your sense of identity and self-worth.
