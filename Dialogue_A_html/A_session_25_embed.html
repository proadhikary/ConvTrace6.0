                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Hi Jacklyn, welcome. I'd like to understand what brought you here today. Can you tell me a bit about what you're experiencing?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I've been feeling really lonely and isolated lately. It hit me hard a few months ago when I had a health scare and realized I didn't have any immediate family to support me.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Jacklyn, I'm so sorry to hear that. It sounds like a really tough experience to go through. Can you tell me more about what that health scare was like for you? What did you go through, and how did it make you feel?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah, it was a really scary time for me. I had to have a procedure done, and I was alone the whole time. I didn't have anyone to talk to, and I felt so vulnerable and helpless. It was like I was completely on my own. Even now, thinking about it makes me feel anxious and overwhelmed.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>That sounds like a really frightening and isolating experience. It's understandable that you'd feel anxious and overwhelmed thinking about it. Can you tell me more about what it was like to be alone during that time? Was there a particular moment or feeling that stands out to you as especially difficult?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah, there was one moment that really stands out to me. I was lying in the hospital bed, waiting for the procedure to be done, and I suddenly felt this overwhelming sense of panic and fear. I thought to myself, What if something goes wrong? Who's going to be there for me? I'm completely alone. It was like this wave of loneliness and fear washed over me, and I couldn't shake it off.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>That sounds like a really intense and frightening experience. It's almost as if you were hit with the reality of your situation, and it felt like you were completely without support. Can you stay with that feeling for a moment, and see if you can find any words to describe what it was like to be in that moment? Was there a sense of vulnerability, or helplessness, or something else entirely?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah, it was like I was completely exposed and defenseless. The thought of being alone and vulnerable in that moment was terrifying, and it made me feel like I was outside of myself, watching myself go through this experience. It's like my mind was racing with all these worst-case scenarios, and I couldn't stop thinking about all the things that could go wrong.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like in that moment, you felt a profound sense of exposure and vulnerability, like you were completely without protection or support. It's as if you were observing yourself from outside, watching this tiny, scared, and helpless person lying in the hospital bed. Can you explore with me what it was like to be in that place of utter helplessness, and what it's like to carry that feeling with you now, even after the procedure is done? How has that sense of exposure and vulnerability changed you, or has it stayed the same?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah, it's been tough to shake off that feeling of vulnerability and helplessness. Even now, when I'm alone at night, I still feel like I'm exposed and defenseless. It's like my mind is constantly racing with worst-case scenarios, and I feel like I'm completely at the mercy of fate.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Can you tell me more about what it's like for you to feel like you're at the mercy of fate? Does that feeling of powerlessness extend beyond just being alone at night, or is it more focused on specific situations or events?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah, it's not just at night when I feel this way. It's like this constant feeling of being at the mercy of fate has become a part of my daily life. Even in situations where I'm with other people, I feel like I'm just going through the motions, waiting for something to go wrong. I've tried to shake it off, but it's like this low-level anxiety is always there, lurking in the background, making me feel like I'm just one step away from disaster.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like this experience of feeling vulnerable and helpless has had a profound impact on your sense of self and your daily life. It's as if you're living in a state of constant hypervigilance, waiting for the other shoe to drop. Can you tell me more about how this feeling of being at the mercy of fate has affected your relationships with others? Have you found yourself pulling back or becoming more withdrawn due to this sense of powerlessness, or is it more of a general sense of anxiety that's always present?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>That's a great question. I think I have started to become more withdrawn, and I've noticed that I'm not reaching out to friends like I used to. I'm just so caught up in my own worries and fears that I don't know how to connect with others anymore. It's like I'm stuck in this endless cycle of anxiety and fear, and I don't know how to break free from it.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're feeling really trapped by this sense of powerlessness and anxiety, like you're living in a state of constant hypervigilance, waiting for the other shoe to drop. It's no wonder you've started to withdraw from others, feeling like you can't connect with them anymore. Can you explore with me what you think would be the first step towards breaking free from this cycle, even if it feels daunting or overwhelming? What small step could you take today, or this week, to start to reclaim some sense of control and agency in your life?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah, I think the first step would be to start small, like taking a walk outside or doing a simple task that I used to enjoy, but haven't been doing lately. I feel like if I can just get out of my own head and focus on the present moment, I might be able to break free from this cycle of anxiety and fear. I've also been thinking about reaching out to a friend or two and being more open about my feelings, but I'm not sure where to start or what to say. Maybe if I can just take that first step and be more authentic with someone, it could help me feel more connected and less alone.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're recognizing that you need to take small steps towards reclaiming some sense of control and agency in your life. I love that you're thinking about taking a walk or doing a simple task that you used to enjoy, as those can be powerful ways to ground yourself in the present moment. And I also appreciate your willingness to consider reaching out to friends and being more open about your feelings. That takes a lot of courage. Can you tell me more about what you're hoping to achieve by being more authentic with someone? What do you hope to get from that experience, and what do you think it might look like if you were to take that step?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think I'm hoping to feel more connected to someone, like I'm not completely alone in this feeling of vulnerability and helplessness. I want to feel like I can share my fears and worries with someone and not be judged or dismissed. I want to feel like I can be myself, flaws and all, without fear of rejection or abandonment.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Can you help me understand what it would mean for you to be yourself, flaws and all, without fear of rejection or abandonment? What would that look like in your daily interactions with others, and what do you think would be the most challenging part of showing up as yourself in that way?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah, I think it would mean being more vulnerable and open with others, not trying to put on a mask or pretend to be someone I'm not. It would mean sharing my true feelings and fears with others, even if it's uncomfortable or scary. For me, that would look like being more authentic and honest in my relationships, and not trying to hide behind a facade of confidence or strength. The most challenging part would be letting go of my fear of rejection or abandonment, and being okay with the possibility that others might not understand or accept me for who I am.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Jacklyn, it takes a lot of courage to be willing to share your true feelings and fears with someone. It sounds like you're hoping to find a sense of connection and understanding with others by being more authentic and vulnerable. Can you tell me more about what you think would happen if you were to take that step and show up as yourself, flaws and all, in your daily interactions with others? What do you think would be the most rewarding part of doing so?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah, I think it would be incredibly empowering to be able to show up as myself, flaws and all, without fear of rejection or abandonment. I imagine it would be like a weight has been lifted off my shoulders, and I could finally be free to be myself without all the anxiety and fear that comes with hiding behind a mask. It would be amazing to feel like I can be vulnerable and open with others, without worrying about being judged or rejected. And I think the most rewarding part would be the sense of connection and understanding I would feel with others, knowing that they accept me for who I am, flaws and all.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like being yourself, flaws and all, without fear of rejection or abandonment would be a truly liberating experience for you. Can you help me understand what you think would be the most challenging part of showing up as yourself in that way? What would be the biggest obstacle for you to overcome in order to be more authentic and honest in your relationships?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think the most challenging part would be letting go of my fear of rejection or abandonment. It's hard for me to be vulnerable and open with others because I'm always worried that they might not accept me or that I'll be hurt in some way. I've built walls around myself as a way of protecting myself from getting hurt, but it's hard to let those walls down and be myself. I'm afraid that if I show up as myself, flaws and all, that others might not like me or that I'll be rejected. That fear is what holds me back from being more authentic and honest in my relationships.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're struggling with a deep-seated fear of rejection and abandonment, which is making it difficult for you to be yourself and be authentic in your relationships. It's like you're constantly weighing the pros and cons of being vulnerable and open with others, and the fear of rejection is holding you back from taking that risk. Can you help me understand what you think would happen if you were to confront this fear head-on and let go of the need to control or manipulate others? What do you think would be the most empowering part of doing so?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think confronting my fear of rejection and abandonment would be incredibly empowering. It would mean that I'm no longer controlled by the fear of what others might think or do. I would be free to be myself, without worrying about being judged or rejected. I imagine it would be like a weight has been lifted off my shoulders, and I could finally be myself without all the anxiety and fear that comes with hiding behind a mask.</div>
