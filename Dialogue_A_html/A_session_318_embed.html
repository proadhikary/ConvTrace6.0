                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Hi Gwen, it's nice to meet you. What brings you here today?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I've been feeling quite inadequate and guilty about my health since I became a vegan a few months ago. I thought it was supposed to make me healthier, but I don't feel any different.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>I'm so sorry to hear that you're feeling inadequate and guilty about your health choices. It sounds like you're really struggling with some internal conflict. Can you tell me more about what you mean by I don't feel any different? What were you hoping to achieve by becoming a vegan, and how are you measuring your progress?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah, I was hoping to improve my overall health and feel more energized, but instead, I've been feeling tired and sluggish a lot of the time. I've been tracking my progress by monitoring my weight and body measurements, but those haven't changed much either.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're really focused on making positive changes in your life, but instead of seeing the results you expected, you're feeling like you're not making progress. Can you tell me more about what you think might be causing these feelings of inadequacy and guilt? Is it internal or external pressure that's making you feel like you're not meeting your own expectations?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah, I think it's a combination of both. I've been comparing myself to others in the vegan community who seem healthier, and that's definitely giving me a hard time. But also, I think I've been putting a lot of pressure on myself to be perfect, to be this ideal vegan who's always healthy and energetic. I feel like if I'm not meeting those expectations, then I'm a failure.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're not only comparing yourself to others, but also to an idealized version of yourself. It's like you're trying to live up to a certain standard, and when you don't meet it, you feel like you've failed. Can you tell me more about what you mean by being a perfect vegan? What does that look like to you, and where did you get that idea?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think I got the idea of being a perfect vegan from social media and online communities. I see all these people who seem to be effortlessly achieving their fitness and health goals, and it creates this unrealistic expectation in my mind. I feel like I should be able to do the same, but since I'm not, I feel like I'm not doing it right. It's like I'm not good enough as a vegan unless I can achieve this idealized version of health and wellness.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like social media has become a significant source of pressure for you, and you're comparing your internal experience to the curated versions of others. This can be really damaging, as it creates an unrealistic expectation of what it means to be a vegan. Can you imagine what it would be like if you could let go of the need to be perfect and instead focus on making choices that feel authentic and meaningful to you? What do you think would change if you released the need to meet others' standards and instead focused on your own needs and desires?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>That's a really interesting question. I think if I could let go of the need to be perfect, I would be able to focus on the reasons why I became a vegan in the first place, which is to improve my health and reduce my environmental impact. I would be able to focus on the small, incremental changes that I've made so far, like reducing my meat intake and trying new plant-based recipes. I think that would help me feel more confident and empowered in my choices, rather than constantly feeling like I'm failing or not good enough.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're really starting to tap into what's driving your feelings of inadequacy and guilt. You're recognizing that social media is a significant source of pressure, and that you're comparing your internal experience to the curated versions of others. That's a really important acknowledgment.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>That's exactly what I need to do, focus on the reasons why I became a vegan in the first place and not get caught up in the idea of being perfect. I think it's going to take some time and effort to shift my mindset, but I'm willing to work on it.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're really aware of the impact that social media is having on your mental health, and you're recognizing the importance of focusing on your own needs and desires rather than trying to meet others' standards. That's a really powerful insight.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think I need to start by acknowledging that social media is a significant source of pressure for me, and that I need to be more mindful of the curated versions of others' experiences. I also need to focus on the reasons why I became a vegan in the first place, which is to improve my health and reduce my environmental impact.</div>

                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think I need to keep reminding myself that I'm not perfect and that it's okay to make mistakes. It's okay to not be a perfect vegan, and it's okay if I don't look like those Instagram influencers. What would be helpful is if I could focus on the small, incremental changes I've made so far, like reducing my meat intake and trying new plant-based recipes. I think that would help me feel more confident and empowered in my choices, rather than constantly feeling like I'm failing or not good enough.</div>

I need to focus on the small, incremental changes I've made so far and celebrate those successes, rather than beating myself up over the things I haven't accomplished.
