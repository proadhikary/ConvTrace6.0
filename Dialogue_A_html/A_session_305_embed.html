                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Hello Leonard, I'm glad you came in today. How are you feeling about being here?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I guess I’m just feeling like I can’t do anything right when it comes to my grandpa. Every little thing seems to set him off, and it makes me feel like I’m failing as a grandson.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>I can sense how frustrating and sad that must be for you. It sounds like you're putting a lot of pressure on yourself to be perfect and make your grandpa happy. Can you tell me more about what's been going on and what specifically sets him off?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah, I guess I am trying to make him happy, but it feels like no matter what I do, it's never good enough. And it's not just the ice cream thing, it's everything. He'll find something to complain about, and it makes me feel like I'm walking on eggshells all the time.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're experiencing a lot of anxiety and stress trying to navigate your relationship with your grandpa. It's like you're constantly trying to avoid conflict or criticism. Have you noticed any patterns or common themes in what sets him off, or is it just a general feeling of being on edge around him?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>That's a good point. I think I do try to avoid conflict or criticism by being extra careful and considerate. But even when I do that, I still feel like I'm not good enough. It's like no matter what I do, I'll always be disappointing him in some way.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're experiencing a sense of hopelessness and helplessness in this relationship. You're trying to avoid conflict and be careful, but it's not seeming to make a difference. Can you think of anything that might be going on from your grandpa's perspective that could be contributing to his criticism and disappointment?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I don't know, maybe he's just a tough person to please or maybe he's just disappointed in me because I'm not the grandson he wanted me to be. I don't think I can really change who I am to make him happy, so I guess I'm just stuck with feeling like I'm not good enough.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're considering your grandpa's perspective and trying to understand where he's coming from. You're also recognizing that you can't change who you are to make him happy, which is a important realization. Can you tell me more about what you mean by not being the grandson he wanted you to be? What specific things do you think he might be disappointed in?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I don't know, maybe he's always wanted a grandson who's more like his old self, you know, more outgoing and adventurous, and I'm just not that person. Maybe I'm just too old and set in my ways for him to accept me.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're wondering if your grandpa is disappointed in you because you don't fit his expectations of what a grandson should be. You're concerned that you're not outgoing and adventurous enough for him, and that's affecting his perception of you. Can you tell me more about what you mean by old and set in your ways? Are there any specific habits or behaviors that you think might be causing him to feel that way?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I guess I feel like I've just gotten comfortable in my own skin, you know? I've learned to appreciate the simple things in life, and I'm not as eager to take risks or try new things like I used to be. Maybe that's what's bothering him, that I'm not the same energetic, adventurous person I was when I was younger.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you've been reflecting on your relationship with your grandpa and are wondering if his criticism and disappointment are due to your changing personality and loss of energy. You're concerned that you're not the same person you used to be and that might be causing him to feel like you're not good enough. Can you think of any ways in which you've noticed your grandpa changing or aging that might be contributing to his expectations of you?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think I've been so focused on my own perceived shortcomings that I haven't really considered how my grandpa might be changing or struggling with his own issues. Maybe he's feeling a sense of loss or regret for not being able to do certain things or be the person he used to be, and that's affecting his expectations of me. It's also possible that he's dealing with his own disappointments and frustrations, and that's what's causing his criticism of me.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>That's a really insightful observation, and it sounds like you're starting to consider the possibility that your grandpa's criticism might not just be about you, but about his own experiences and struggles. It's like you're starting to see that this is a two-way street, and that his expectations and criticisms might be influenced by his own aging process and personal struggles. Can you think of any ways in which you might be able to connect with your grandpa on this level, and have a more empathetic and understanding conversation with him about your feelings and concerns?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah, I think I can try to approach him with more empathy and understanding, but it's hard for me to imagine how he could be struggling with his own issues when he seems so critical and disappointed in me all the time. I guess I'll have to try to separate my own feelings of inadequacy from the possibility that he might be dealing with his own stuff.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're recognizing that your grandpa's criticism might not just be about you, but about his own experiences and struggles. That's a really important insight. I'd like to encourage you to keep exploring this idea and see if you can find ways to connect with your grandpa on this level. It might be helpful to have a conversation with him about your feelings and concerns, and to try to understand what's going on from his perspective. Can you think of any specific questions you might ask him, or any topics you might want to discuss with him, that could help you better understand his point of view and potentially improve your relationship with him?</div>

                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I don't know, maybe I am trying to control the situation too much or being too rigid in my expectations.
