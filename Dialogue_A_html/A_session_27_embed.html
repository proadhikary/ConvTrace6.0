                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Hi Jacklyn, welcome. I'm glad you decided to come in today. To start, could you tell me a bit about what's been going on for you lately?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I just can't seem to shake off this feeling of being completely alone. Even when I try to reach out to friends or engage in my hobbies, the loneliness is always there, especially at night. It feels like nothing I do makes a difference.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Wow, Jacklyn, it sounds like you're really struggling with feeling disconnected and isolated, even when you're surrounded by people or doing things you enjoy. Can you tell me more about what you mean by 'nothing I do makes a difference'? What are some specific things you've been trying to do to connect with others or feel more fulfilled, and how have they been falling short for you?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I don't know, it's just like... nothing I do is ever enough. I'll try to reach out to friends, but they don't really get it, and I end up feeling like I'm just bothering them. Or I'll try to distract myself with hobbies, but it's just a temporary fix. And even when I do manage to do something that brings me a little joy, it's like it's just a fleeting moment, and then the loneliness comes back. It's like I'm just stuck in this rut, and I don't know how to get out of it.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're feeling like you're not good enough, or that your efforts aren't good enough, to connect with others or feel fulfilled. It's like you're carrying this heavy weight of responsibility to make things work, and even when you do try, it feels like it's not enough. Can you tell me more about what you mean by 'they don't really get it'? What do you think your friends are missing, or not understanding, about your experience of loneliness?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I don't think they can understand it because they've never experienced it themselves. They're always trying to offer solutions or tell me to just be positive or focus on the good things, but they don't get that it's not that simple. It's not just about being positive or focusing on the good things; it's about feeling a deep sense of connection and belonging that I just don't have.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're feeling like your friends are well-intentioned, but they're not really understanding the depth of your experience. It's like they're trying to offer Band-Aids for a wound that needs surgery. Can you tell me more about what you mean by 'a deep sense of connection and belonging'? What does that feel like to you, and what do you think would need to happen for you to feel like you have that?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>It's hard to put into words, but it's like... I've always been someone who values independence and self-sufficiency, but at the same time, I've always craved that sense of connection and belonging. And now, it feels like I'm stuck in this limbo where I'm too proud to admit that I need help or support, but at the same time, I'm desperate for someone to talk to, someone who understands what I'm going through. It's like I'm torn between being strong and being vulnerable, and I don't know how to reconcile those two parts of myself.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're struggling with the tension between your desire for independence and your need for connection and belonging. It's as if you're caught between two opposing forces, and it's causing a lot of inner conflict for you. Can you tell me more about what you mean by being too proud to admit that I need help or support? What does that look like for you, and how do you think that's impacting your ability to form meaningful connections with others?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think being too proud to admit that I need help or support is just a way of protecting myself from being rejected or judged. I've always been someone who likes to be self-sufficient and handle things on my own, and I guess that's just become a part of who I am. But at the same time, it's exhausting trying to do everything by myself, and it's making me feel even more isolated and alone. I don't know how to let go of that pride and ask for help without feeling like I'm admitting defeat or being weak.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're carrying a heavy burden of self-reliance, Jacklyn, and it's causing you a lot of distress. It's like you're trying to hold everything together on your own, and it's not only exhausting you but also making you feel more isolated and alone. I want to acknowledge that it takes a lot of courage to admit when we need help, and it's okay to ask for support. Can you imagine what it would be like to have someone who truly understands and accepts you, flaws and all, and is willing to help you through this tough time? What does that look like to you, and what do you think would need to happen for you to feel comfortable reaching out for help?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>It's hard to imagine that kind of support, because it seems like everyone I've tried to reach out to in the past has let me down or hasn't truly understood what I'm going through. I'm not sure how to trust that someone new would be any different.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Can you tell me more about what you mean by everyone I've tried to reach out to in the past has let me down or hasn't truly understood what I'm going through? Are there any specific relationships or experiences that stand out to you as particularly painful or disappointing, and how have you been carrying those feelings with you over time?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think about my parents a lot. Growing up, I always felt like I was a burden to them because I was an only child, and they had to work twice as hard to provide for me. Even when I was older and moved out, I felt like they were still holding back from being close to me because they were worried about losing me or not being able to take care of me. And now, even though they're gone, I still feel like I'm carrying that sense of being a burden with me. It's like I'm stuck in this cycle of feeling like I'm not good enough or worthy of love and connection, and it's hard for me to break free from it.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like your experiences with your parents have had a profound impact on your sense of self-worth and your ability to form connections with others. It's as if you've internalized the message that you're a burden and that you're not worthy of love and connection. Can you tell me more about how you think this has influenced your relationships and your ability to trust others? How do you think this is showing up in your current feelings of loneliness and disconnection?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think it's just really hard for me to trust that anyone will ever truly understand me or be there for me, because my parents never really were. They always seemed so worried about their own problems and stressors that they never really made an effort to connect with me on a deeper level. And now, even though I'm grown and independent, I still feel like I'm carrying that sense of not being worthy or lovable with me. It's like I'm always waiting for the other shoe to drop, for someone to realize that I'm not good enough and that they're only tolerating me because of some obligation or responsibility.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like your experiences with your parents have had a profound impact on your sense of self-worth and your ability to form connections with others. It's as if you've internalized the message that you're a burden and that you're not worthy of love and connection. Can you imagine what it would be like to have a relationship where you feel seen, heard, and understood, and where you don't have to carry that heavy burden of self-reliance? What would that look like to you, and what do you think would need to happen for you to feel safe enough to let go of some of that self-protection and trust that someone else might be able to support you?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think it's really hard for me to imagine a relationship like that, because I've never really experienced it before. It's like I'm stuck in this cycle of self-doubt and self-reliance, and I don't know how to break free from it. Even when I try to reach out for help or support, I feel like I'm just pretending to be vulnerable, like I'm just going through the motions without really being authentic. It's like I'm trapped in this never-ending cycle of trying to prove myself, trying to be good enough, and trying to be worthy of love and connection.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're carrying a heavy weight of self-doubt and self-reliance, and it's exhausting you. It's like you're trying to prove yourself to others, but more importantly, to yourself.

Can you imagine what it would be like to have a relationship where you feel like you can be your authentic self, without having to prove yourself or be perfect? What would that look like to you, and what do you think would need to happen for you to feel safe enough to let go of some of that self-protection and trust that someone else might be able to support you?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I don't know, it's just like...

                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're at a breaking point, Jacklyn, and that's a really powerful place to be.
