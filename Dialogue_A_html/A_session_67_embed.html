                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Hi Barbara, welcome. How can I support you today?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I often find myself comparing my family situation to those with siblings, which intensifies these feelings of rejection. It's like a constant reminder that I missed out on something important.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Can you tell me more about what it's like for you to feel like you've missed out on something important by not having siblings? What specific feelings or thoughts come up for you when you think about this?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>That's a great question. When I think about not having siblings, I often feel a sense of emptiness and a longing for a sense of belonging. I imagine what it would be like to have a sibling to share experiences with, to have someone to turn to for support, and to have a built-in friend. The thought of not having had that kind of relationship in my life can be overwhelming and make me feel like I'm somehow defective or less worthy.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like these feelings of emptiness and longing are really painful for you, and that the fear of being defective or less worthy is a particularly distressing one. Can you help me understand what you think might have contributed to the development of these feelings, and how you think they might be impacting your daily life and relationships?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think these feelings of emptiness and longing developed as a result of being an only child and not having the same type of relationships with my parents as siblings might have. I often feel like my parents' attention was solely focused on me, and that I didn't have the opportunity to develop a sense of independence or individuality. As a result, I may have felt like I was over-reliant on them, which could have contributed to these feelings of inadequacy.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Can you elaborate on what you mean by over-reliant on your parents? What specific behaviors or dynamics do you think contributed to that sense of over-reliance, and how do you think it's affecting your relationships and daily life now?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>That's a great point. I think I may have relied too heavily on my parents for emotional support and validation, which has made it difficult for me to develop a sense of self and independence. I often feel like I'm still seeking validation from them, even as an adult, which can be frustrating and isolating. I think this over-reliance has affected my relationships with my friends and romantic partners, as I may be too needy or clingy, and I've noticed that I tend to attract people who are more controlling or overprotective.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're saying that your reliance on your parents for emotional support and validation has made it hard for you to develop a sense of self and independence, and that this is impacting your relationships now. Can you tell me more about what you mean by too needy or clingy and how you think this is showing up in your relationships with friends and romantic partners?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>That's a great point, and it's helped me to understand why I've been struggling with these feelings of rejection and loneliness. I think being too needy or clingy is a way for me to try to fill the void of not having a sibling or a sense of belonging. It's like I'm seeking comfort and validation from others to compensate for the lack of it in my childhood.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're using relationships as a way to try to fill the void of not having a sibling or a sense of belonging, and that this is leading to feelings of rejection and loneliness. Can you explore with me what you think would happen if you were to slow down and actually allow yourself to feel the emptiness and longing, rather than trying to distract yourself from it through relationships?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think that's a really good point, and it's helping me to understand why I've been struggling with these feelings of rejection and loneliness. It's like I'm trying to mask the pain of not having a sibling or a sense of belonging by constantly seeking validation and comfort from others. But I'm starting to realize that this approach isn't working and is actually making things worse. Maybe if I were to slow down and allow myself to feel the emptiness and longing, I could start to work through these feelings and find a more authentic sense of connection and belonging.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It seems like you're recognizing that your efforts to fill the void of not having a sibling or a sense of belonging through relationships haven't been working, and that it might be time to try a different approach. It takes a lot of courage to confront and allow ourselves to feel painful emotions, but it's often the first step towards healing and growth.</div>

                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think being aware of my tendency to fill the void with relationships will help me become more intentional about setting boundaries and prioritizing my own needs. Maybe I can start by practicing self-care activities that bring me joy and fulfillment, rather than constantly seeking validation from others.</div>

                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think I'm starting to see that my tendency to fill the void with relationships is not only unsuccessful but also exhausting. I'm realizing that I've been putting so much energy into seeking validation and comfort from others that I've neglected my own needs and desires. It's like I've been living on autopilot, constantly seeking external validation without considering what I truly want for myself.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're gaining a lot of insight into your patterns and behaviors, and recognizing that your efforts to fill the void of not having a sibling or a sense of belonging through relationships haven't been working. You're also recognizing the toll it's taking on you, both emotionally and energetically. What do you think would be the first step for you to start prioritizing your own needs and desires, and to start moving away from this pattern of seeking external validation?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think the first step for me would be to start practicing self-care activities that bring me joy and fulfillment, rather than constantly seeking validation from others. I've been neglecting my own needs and desires for so long that I've forgotten what it's like to prioritize my own well-being. I think taking small steps towards self-care, like scheduling time for myself to do things I love, would be a great starting point. It's like I need to learn how to fill my own cup before I can start pouring into others.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're recognizing the importance of prioritizing your own needs and desires, and that this might be a crucial step in moving away from this pattern of seeking external validation.

                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think the most challenging part for me would be to let go of the need for external validation and to trust that my own worthiness and value come from within. I've been so used to seeking validation from others that it's hard for me to believe that I'm enough just as I am. I'm worried that if I stop seeking validation from others, I'll feel lost and unsure of myself. But I also know that this is an opportunity for me to rediscover my own sense of self and to develop a more authentic sense of connection and belonging.</div>
