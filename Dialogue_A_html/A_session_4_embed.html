                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Hi Travis, it's nice to meet you. How can I support you today?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I've been struggling with some anxiety and self-doubt, particularly in relation to my hobby of building furniture.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Travis, it sounds like you're experiencing some challenges with your hobby, which can be really frustrating and impacting on your well-being. Can you tell me more about what's been going on with building furniture that's causing you to feel anxious and doubtful about yourself? What are some specific situations or thoughts that come up for you when you're working on a project?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yes, I can definitely elaborate on that. When I think about starting a new furniture project, I always worry that if I can't find seasoned oak, the entire piece will look terrible, and I'll be unable to share it with others. This fear has been holding me back from even attempting to build something new, and it's really affecting my self-esteem.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're feeling quite stuck and uncertain about your ability to build furniture due to this fear around finding the right type of wood. Can you tell me more about what's driving this fear? Is it a past experience or a concern that's been voiced by someone else that's making you worry about not being able to find the right wood?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>That fear started after a traumatic experience of being held hostage in a store robbery situation a year ago, and it's been lingering ever since. I think the anxiety and self-doubt that I experienced during that incident have somehow become linked to my fear of not being able to find seasoned oak, making me believe that my furniture will always look terrible if I don't have it. It's like my mind is constantly telling me that I'm not good enough as a builder unless I have that specific type of wood.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like the traumatic experience you went through has had a significant impact on your thoughts and feelings about your hobby. It's not uncommon for traumatic events to trigger fears and anxieties that can generalize to other areas of life, including activities we enjoy. It's as if your mind is trying to protect you from potential failure or rejection by linking your fear of not having seasoned oak to your self-worth as a builder. Can you tell me more about how you think this fear has been affecting your daily life and relationships, outside of your hobby?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>That's a great insight, counselor. I think this fear has been affecting my daily life in many ways. I've become more anxious and withdrawn, avoiding social events and conversations about my hobby because I'm afraid others will judge my work. I've also been having trouble focusing on my job as a house cleaner, and my relationships with friends have become strained because I don't want to talk about my fears and anxieties.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like this fear is having a significant impact on your daily life, causing you to withdraw from social situations and affecting your relationships and work. It's understandable that you would want to avoid talking about your fears and anxieties, as it can feel overwhelming and vulnerable to share them with others. Can you tell me more about what you hope to achieve by coming to therapy? What are your goals for our work together, and what do you think would be a meaningful outcome for you?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>That's a great question, counselor. Honestly, I just want to feel more confident in my ability to build furniture, regardless of the type of wood I use. I want to be able to enjoy the process without constant anxiety and self-doubt holding me back. I also hope to be able to share my projects with others without feeling embarrassed or ashamed. Ultimately, I want to be able to separate my self-worth from my ability to build furniture and focus on the joy and creativity that comes with it.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're hoping to regain your confidence and freedom to enjoy your hobby without being held back by these fears and doubts. It's also important for you to feel comfortable sharing your projects with others and not be defined by your fear of not having seasoned oak. Can you tell me what you think would happen if you were able to overcome this fear and build a piece of furniture that you're proud of, even if it's not made of seasoned oak? What would that mean for you, and how would you feel about yourself in that moment?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think if I could overcome this fear and build a piece of furniture that I'm proud of, it would mean a lot to me. It would mean that I've taken control of my anxiety and self-doubt, and I'm no longer letting my fear dictate my actions. I would feel proud of myself for pushing past my limitations and trying new things, even if it doesn't turn out exactly as I envisioned. It would also mean that I'm more confident in my abilities as a builder, and I'm not defined by my fear of not having seasoned oak.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're hoping that overcoming this fear would give you a sense of pride and accomplishment, not just in your ability to build furniture, but also in your ability to face and overcome your fears. It's like you're saying, If I can do this, I can do anything. Can you tell me more about what you think would happen if you were able to build a piece of furniture that you're proud of, and what that would mean for your overall sense of self-worth?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think it would be a huge step forward for me to be able to acknowledge that my self-worth isn't tied to finding seasoned oak. It would mean that I'm not giving up my power to a specific type of wood, and instead, I'm taking control of my anxiety and self-doubt. Building a piece of furniture that I'm proud of, regardless of the type of wood, would be a declaration that I'm capable and confident in my abilities, and that's a feeling I'd like to experience more often.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like building a piece of furniture that you're proud of, regardless of the type of wood, would be a powerful experience for you. It would be a way of demonstrating to yourself that you're capable and confident in your abilities, and that your self-worth isn't tied to a specific outcome. Can you imagine what that would be like, to be able to look at a piece of furniture you've built and feel a sense of pride and accomplishment, rather than anxiety and self-doubt?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I can see how my fear of not having seasoned oak has been holding me back from fully enjoying my hobby and sharing my projects with others. I think what's been hardest for me is feeling like I'm not good enough as a builder unless I have that specific type of wood. But, as we've been talking, I'm starting to realize that my self-worth isn't tied to finding seasoned oak. It's like I've been giving up my power to a specific type of wood, and I want to take that back. I want to be able to build furniture that I'm proud of, regardless of the type of wood, and feel confident in my abilities.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're hoping to break free from the grip of this fear and find a sense of pride and accomplishment in your ability to build furniture, regardless of the type of wood. It's a beautiful goal, and I'm excited to work with you to achieve it.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I'm starting to see that my fear of not having seasoned oak is not only holding me back from building furniture, but also affecting my daily life and relationships. I've become more anxious and withdrawn, avoiding social events and conversations about my hobby. I've also been having trouble focusing on my job as a house cleaner, and my relationships with friends have become strained because I don't want to talk about my fears and anxieties.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're feeling a sense of relief and understanding about how your fear of not having seasoned oak has been impacting your life. It's as if you're starting to see that this fear is not only holding you back from building furniture, but also affecting your relationships and daily life. It's a powerful realization to have, and it's a great step towards making changes. Can you tell me more about what you think would happen if you were able to overcome this fear and start building furniture again, even if it's not made of seasoned oak? What would that mean for you, and how would you feel about yourself in that moment?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>This fear has been holding me back from sharing my projects with others and enjoying the process of building furniture without constant anxiety.

Can we explore some strategies together for how you can start building furniture again, even if it's not made of seasoned oak? What do you think would be a good first step for you to take in overcoming this fear and regaining your confidence in your ability to build furniture?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think a good first step for me would be to start by building a piece of furniture using a different type of wood. Maybe I could start with a smaller project, like a birdhouse or a picture frame, and see how it turns out. I think this would help me build confidence in my ability to build furniture without relying on seasoned oak, and it would also give me a sense of accomplishment and pride in my work. Additionally, I would like to keep a journal of my progress and write down my thoughts and feelings about each project I complete. This would help me track my progress and identify any patterns or triggers that may be contributing to my fear.</div>

                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think it would be helpful to identify the specific negative self-talk and unhelpful thoughts that are contributing to my fear of not having seasoned oak. I've been noticing that whenever I think about building a new project, my mind starts racing with thoughts like What if it looks terrible? or I'm not good enough as a builder unless I have seasoned oak. I think if I can become more aware of these thoughts and challenge them with more balanced and realistic ones, I might be able to reduce my anxiety and self-doubt. It would also be helpful to work on building my self-compassion and reframing my thoughts in a more positive and constructive way.</div>
