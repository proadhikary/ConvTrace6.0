                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Hi Christopher, welcome. How are you feeling today?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I just feel like no matter what I do, I'm never going to get a job. It's like I'm stuck in this endless loop of rejections and it's really hard to stay motivated.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Can you tell me more about what you mean by 'endless loop of rejections'? What are some of the things you've been applying for, and what kind of responses have you been getting?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah, I just feel like I'm not good enough. I apply for jobs, and then I don't hear back. It's like they're just ignoring me. And even when I do get a rejection email, it's always the same generic message. It's like they're not even bothering to personalize it. It's really frustrating and demotivating.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>I can understand why that would be really discouraging and frustrating. It sounds like you're putting a lot of effort into job applications, and then feeling like you're not even getting a response, let alone a positive one. Can you tell me more about what you think you need to get a job? Is there something specific you think is holding you back or making you feel like you're not good enough?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I don't know, I just feel like I'm not good enough, no matter what I do. I'm always going to be stuck in this rut, and it's just so hopeless.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're carrying a lot of self-doubt and shame around your job search. It's like you're assuming that you're not good enough, and that's why you're not getting hired. Can you help me challenge that assumption? What are some things you're good at, and what are some strengths you bring to the table?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah, I don't know... I just feel like I'm not doing anything right. I'm not a great communicator, I don't have the right skills, I'm not motivated... I mean, what's the point of even trying, right?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>I'm hearing that you're beating yourself up over a lot of things, and it's feeling overwhelming. Can you help me identify one thing that you think you're not good at, and let's break it down together? What's one specific situation where you felt like you struggled with communication, for example? Sometimes when we focus on one thing, it can feel less overwhelming and we can start to build on that.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>It's just hard for me to see anything positive about myself. I feel like every time I try to highlight my strengths, I'm just reminded of all the things I'm not good at. It's like, no matter how hard I try, I'm just going to be stuck in this rut forever. I don't know how to change that.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're caught in a cycle of self-criticism, where you're focusing on all the things you think you're not good at, and it's hard for you to see any strengths or positives about yourself. I want to gently challenge that assumption. Can you imagine that, right now, there's a part of you that's capable of doing things well? Maybe it's not something you're immediately aware of, but what if you had a small, tiny spark of confidence that you could build upon? What would that look like for you?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I don't know... it sounds cheesy, but I guess I would feel more confident if I could just get a job, you know? Like, if I could just prove to myself that I'm capable of doing something right.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>I understand what you mean by that. It sounds like you're hoping that getting a job would be a proof of your abilities and confidence. But what if getting a job isn't the only way to prove that to yourself? What if, right now, you could start to build that tiny spark of confidence by acknowledging some small successes or strengths you have? Would you be willing to explore that with me?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I don't know, it sounds cheesy, but I guess I would feel more confident if I could just get a job, you know? Like, if I could just prove to myself that I'm capable of doing something right.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're hoping that getting a job would be a proof of your abilities and confidence. But what if getting a job isn't the only way to prove that to yourself? What if, right now, you could start to build that tiny spark of confidence by acknowledging some small successes or strengths you have? Would you be willing to explore that with me?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>It's hard to imagine a world where I'm capable of doing things well, because every time I try to think about my strengths, I'm immediately met with all the things I'm not good at. It feels like I'm constantly bombarded with negative self-talk and it's really hard to quiet that voice in my head.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like your inner critic is very loud and dominant, and it's hard for you to quiet it down and focus on your strengths. Can you imagine that your inner critic is like a loud, obnoxious roommate who's always speaking up and trying to drown out other voices? What if you were to give this roommate a name, and then imagine that you're having a conversation with them? How would you respond to this roommate's constant negative chatter?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I don't know, it's like that roommate is just so loud and persistent that I feel like I can't even think about my strengths without it jumping in and telling me all the things I'm not good at. It's like, no matter how hard I try to focus on the positive, this roommate just keeps shouting over me and making it impossible to hear anything else.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like your inner critic is not only loud but also very persuasive, and it's hard for you to counteract its negative messages. Giving this roommate a name can help us work with it more effectively. Let's call it Critic Chris. How would you respond to Critic Chris if it were to say, You're not good enough, you'll never get a job, you're a failure?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah, I mean, I guess I would try to tell Critic Chris that it's not helping me, that it's just making me feel worse and not allowing me to focus on my strengths. But then Critic Chris would just come back with more negative stuff, like You're just being naive, you're not good enough, you'll never be good enough...</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like Critic Chris is a very persistent and persuasive voice in your head. It's amazing that you're aware of its impact on your thoughts and feelings. I'd like to explore this further. Can you imagine that Critic Chris is actually trying to protect you from something? What do you think it might be trying to protect you from? Is it trying to protect you from failure, rejection, or something else?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think Critic Chris is trying to protect me from feeling vulnerable and exposed. It's like, if I don't think I'm good enough, then I don't have to risk getting hurt or rejected. It's a way for me to maintain control over the situation and avoid feeling like I'm putting myself out there and potentially getting hurt.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're using Critic Chris as a way to maintain control and avoid feeling vulnerable and exposed. That's a very understandable coping mechanism, but it's also limiting your ability to move forward and explore your strengths. I'd like to explore this further. Can you imagine what would happen if you were to let go of Critic Chris's need to control and protect you? Would you feel more open to exploring your strengths and taking risks, or would you feel even more anxious and uncertain?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>It's hard for me to imagine letting go of Critic Chris's control, because it's been a part of me for so long. But I think if I could learn to silence it and focus on my strengths, I might feel more confident and open to taking risks. It's scary to think about because what if I fail? But at the same time, what if I succeed?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Can you help me understand what you mean by not good enough? Is it a specific skill or area of your life where you feel like you're not measuring up, or is it more of a general feeling of inadequacy?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think it's a general feeling of inadequacy. I feel like no matter what I do, I'm always going to be compared to someone else and found lacking. It's like, I'll apply for a job and think I'm qualified, but then I'll see someone else get hired and think, Oh, they're so much better than me. And it's like, I'll never be good enough.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like this feeling of not good enough is deeply ingrained and tied to your sense of self-worth. It's as if you're constantly comparing yourself to others and feeling like you're falling short. Can you imagine what it would be like to let go of that constant comparison and focus on your own unique strengths and accomplishments, rather than trying to measure up to someone else's standards?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I'm starting to see that maybe I've been looking at this all wrong. Maybe instead of focusing on what I'm not good at, I should be focusing on what I am good at and what I can do well. It's like, I've been so caught up in this negative self-talk that I've forgotten what I'm capable of.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're starting to recognize that your focus on what you're not good at is actually holding you back and making it hard for you to see your strengths. I want to gently challenge that assumption. What if, instead of focusing on what you're not good at, you were to focus on one small thing that you're actually good at? Something that comes naturally to you, or something that you've excelled at in the past. What would that look like for you?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think it would look like focusing on my problem-solving skills. I've always been good at breaking down complex problems into smaller, manageable parts and finding creative solutions. But when I'm in the midst of a job search, it's hard for me to remember that and instead I get caught up in negative self-talk about how I'm not good enough.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're starting to recognize that your focus on what you're not good at is actually holding you back and making it hard for you to see your strengths. That's a really important insight.</div>

                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think it's been really helpful to explore this with you, but I'm still struggling to see how I can apply this to my job search. I feel like I'm just stuck in this rut and I don't know how to get out of it.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're feeling a bit overwhelmed and stuck in your job search, and it's hard to see a way forward. Can we try to break it down into smaller, more manageable steps? What if we start by identifying one small thing that you're actually good at, like your problem-solving skills, and then think about how you could apply that to your job search? Maybe there's a particular type of job or industry where your skills would be particularly valuable. Or maybe there's a way you could use your skills to stand out in a crowded job market. Let's brainstorm together and see if we can come up with some ideas.</div>
