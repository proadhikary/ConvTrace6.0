                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Hi Julia, welcome. I’m glad you’re here today. How are you feeling right now?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I’ve been replaying the moments before my cat passed away over and over in my head, and I just can’t shake the feeling that I could have done more to prevent it.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>I'm so sorry to hear about the loss of your cat, Julia. It sounds like you're carrying a lot of guilt and regret with you. Can you tell me more about what's going through your mind when you replay those moments? What are some of the thoughts that keep coming up for you?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah, it's like my mind is stuck on the idea that if I had done something differently, my cat would still be alive. I keep thinking about all the things I could have done to prevent its death, like taking it to the vet more often or keeping a closer eye on it. It's like my brain is constantly replaying the what ifs and it's really hard for me to shake those feelings.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like those what ifs are really haunting you, Julia. It's as if your mind is trying to make sense of the situation by replaying and rehashing the events leading up to your cat's passing. Can you tell me more about what you think would have happened if you had done things differently? What are some of the specific scenarios that play out in your mind?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>It's hard to specify, but I think about all the little things I could have done differently, like making sure the cat's food and water bowls were always full, or checking on it more frequently. It's like my brain is trying to find a way to avoid the pain and guilt by replaying these scenarios over and over.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're trying to find a way to regain control over the situation by replaying those scenarios, Julia. Can you tell me what you think would happen if you stopped replaying those what ifs and just allowed yourself to feel the pain and guilt right now, without trying to change the past?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>That's a tough one. I think I've been using those thoughts as a way to distract myself from the pain of losing my cat. If I stopped replaying them, I'm not sure what would happen. I'm scared of feeling even more overwhelmed by the guilt and sadness.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Julia, it takes a lot of courage to admit that you're using those thoughts as a way to distract yourself from the pain. It's almost as if you're afraid of the feelings that would come up if you stopped replaying those scenarios. I want to acknowledge that it's okay to feel overwhelmed, and it's okay to feel the pain and guilt right now. Can you imagine what it would be like to let yourself feel those emotions, without judgment or expectation of changing the past? What would happen if you allowed yourself to grieve your cat's loss in the present moment, without trying to escape or distract yourself?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah, it's hard to imagine just letting go of those thoughts and feelings, but I guess it's scary to think about being consumed by them too. I'm worried that if I stop replaying those scenarios, I'll be left with nothing but emptiness and regret.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Julia, it sounds like you're afraid of being left with a sense of emptiness and regret if you stop replaying those thoughts. Can you imagine what it would be like to hold both the pain of losing your cat and the regret in a sense of acceptance, rather than trying to distract yourself from it? What would it mean to you to acknowledge that the loss is real, and that it's okay to feel the pain and guilt in this moment, without trying to change the past or distract yourself from it?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think it's possible to imagine holding both the pain of losing my cat and the regret in a sense of acceptance, but it's hard for me to wrap my head around what that would look like in practice. I'm worried that if I stop replaying those thoughts, I'll be left with a sense of emptiness and regret, and I'm not sure what would fill that void.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're feeling really stuck between the desire to hold onto the what ifs and the fear of being left with nothing but emptiness and regret if you let go of them. I want to acknowledge that it's understandable to feel this way, given the depth of your connection with your cat. But I also want to gently encourage you to explore what it might mean to allow yourself to feel the pain and guilt right now, without trying to change the past or distract yourself from it. Can you imagine what it would be like to sit with the loss of your cat, and to acknowledge the regret and pain that comes with it, without trying to avoid or escape from it? What would it mean to you to give yourself permission to feel this way, and to find a way to hold onto the memory of your cat while also acknowledging the pain of their loss?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think I'm starting to understand what you're getting at, but it's still really hard for me to imagine just accepting the loss and the guilt without trying to do something to change it. It feels like I'm being asked to give up control and just accept the pain without trying to do anything about it.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Julia, it sounds like you're feeling a strong desire to hold onto control and find a way to change the past, even if it's just through replaying those what ifs in your mind. I want to gently challenge you to consider that perhaps the control you're seeking is an illusion. By replaying those scenarios, you're not actually changing the past, you're just creating a sense of temporary distraction from the pain and guilt. And while it may be comforting to hold onto that sense of control, it's also preventing you from fully experiencing and processing the emotions you're feeling right now. Would you be willing to explore what it would be like to let go of the need for control and just allow yourself to feel the pain and guilt, without trying to change the past or distract yourself from it?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I'm not sure I'm ready to give up the control of replaying those scenarios just yet. It's hard for me to imagine a life without that sense of control, even if it is an illusion. Can you help me explore what I would gain by letting go of that need for control, and what I would lose if I continued to hold onto it?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Julia, it's understandable that the need for control is a strong desire for you right now. It's as if you're clinging to it as a way to feel safe and secure in the midst of this overwhelming loss. But I want to gently suggest that perhaps the control you're seeking is not actually giving you the sense of security and comfort you think it is. In fact, it may be preventing you from experiencing and processing the emotions you're feeling in the present moment. By holding onto the need for control, you're also holding onto the guilt and regret, and preventing yourself from fully grieving the loss of your cat. Would you be willing to explore what it would mean to let go of the need for control, and what you might gain by doing so? What might you gain by allowing yourself to feel the pain and guilt, without trying to change the past or distract yourself from it?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think I'm starting to see that my need for control is rooted in my fear of feeling overwhelmed by the pain and guilt. I'm not sure what I would gain by letting go of that need, but I'm also not sure what I would lose. It's scary to think about being without that sense of control, but it's also exhausting to keep replaying those what ifs in my head. Can you help me explore what it would mean to let go of the need for control and find a way to grieve my cat's loss without trying to change the past?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're really struggling with the idea of letting go of control and just allowing yourself to feel the pain and guilt of your cat's loss. I want to acknowledge that it's a scary thought, but also a brave one. By holding onto the need for control, you're also holding onto the guilt and regret, and preventing yourself from fully grieving the loss of your cat.
