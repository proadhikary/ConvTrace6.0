                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Hi David, I'm glad you decided to come in today. What brings you here?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I've been dealing with a lot of anxiety as I get closer to finishing my degree. I can't shake the feeling that something will go wrong and I'll end up not graduating. Itâ€™s been getting worse lately, and it's really affecting my ability to focus on my studies and daily life.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>David, it sounds like you're carrying a significant amount of weight on your shoulders. It's understandable to feel anxious about completing your degree, especially when there's a lot at stake. Can you tell me more about what specifically is causing you to worry about not graduating? Is there something specific that's been on your mind lately, or is it more of a general feeling of uncertainty?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Honestly, I think it's just the fear of the unknown. I've had setbacks in the past when I was close to achieving a goal, and I'm worried that it might happen again. I keep thinking about all the things that could go wrong, like not being able to find a job after graduation or not being able to keep up with the coursework.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're struggling with a sense of vulnerability and uncertainty about the future. It's natural to feel that way, especially when you've experienced setbacks in the past. It's like you're trying to prepare for every possible worst-case scenario. Can you help me understand what you mean by not being able to find a job after graduation? What specific fears are attached to that idea for you?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah, I guess I'm just worried that I won't be able to find a job that aligns with my degree or that I'll be stuck in a dead-end job for years to come. It's like, I've been working so hard towards this goal, and the thought of not being able to achieve it feels like a failure.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like the fear of not being able to find a job that aligns with your degree is closely tied to your sense of identity and purpose. It's as if you've invested so much of yourself in this goal that the thought of not achieving it feels like a threat to your sense of self. Can you help me understand what it would mean to you to find a job that aligns with your degree? What aspects of your identity or sense of purpose are tied up in this outcome?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah, I think so. It would mean a lot to me to find a job that aligns with my degree because it would validate all the hard work and sacrifices I've made. It would also give me a sense of direction and purpose, which I feel is currently missing. It's like, if I can't find a job that aligns with my degree, then what was the point of all this?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like finding a job that aligns with your degree is not just about having a secure financial situation, but it's also deeply connected to your sense of self-worth and purpose. It's as if you're hoping that this outcome would give you a sense of validation and direction that you're currently missing. Can you help me understand what would happen if, despite your best efforts, you didn't find a job that aligns with your degree? What would be the most difficult part for you in that scenario?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think the hardest part for me would be feeling like I've failed in some way, like all my efforts were for nothing. I would probably feel a sense of disappointment and frustration, not just with myself but also with the system, like the education system didn't prepare me well enough for the real world.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like the fear of not finding a job that aligns with your degree is deeply tied to your sense of identity and self-worth. You've invested a lot in this goal and the thought of not achieving it feels like a threat to your sense of self. Can you help me explore this idea of failure? What does failure mean to you, and how do you think it would impact your daily life and relationships if you didn't find a job that aligns with your degree?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think it would be really hard for me to accept that I didn't find a job that aligns with my degree. It would feel like a failure, not just in terms of my career but also in terms of my identity.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like the idea of failure is deeply tied to your sense of identity and self-worth. It's as if you've defined yourself as a successful student and future professional based on achieving this specific goal. Can you help me explore what would happen if you were to redefine your sense of identity and self-worth outside of this one goal? What would that look like for you, and how might it shift your perspective on the idea of failure?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I'm not sure, it's hard for me to imagine a life where I'm not defined by this goal. I think it would be a big adjustment, but maybe it would give me more freedom to explore other aspects of my life and identity.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're carrying a lot of weight on your shoulders, David. It's understandable to feel anxious about completing your degree, especially when there's a lot at stake.

                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think it's hard for me to imagine a life where I'm not defined by this goal, but at the same time, it's also kind of freeing to think that I could be more than just this one thing.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're carrying a sense of responsibility to uphold a certain image of yourself, and the thought of not achieving this goal feels like a threat to that image. It's as if you've defined yourself as a successful student and future professional based on achieving this specific goal. Can you help me understand what would happen if you were to let go of the need to be defined by this one goal and instead focus on what you value and what brings you joy? How might that shift your perspective on the idea of failure and what it would mean for you to succeed?</div>

Maybe if I could focus on those things, I wouldn't be so tied up in this one goal and would be more open to the possibilities that come with not achieving it.</div>
