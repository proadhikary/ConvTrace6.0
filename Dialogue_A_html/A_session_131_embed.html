                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Hi Michael, it's nice to meet you. How are you feeling today?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I'm feeling a bit overwhelmed, to be honest. This is all pretty new to me, and I'm not sure where to start.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>I completely understand. It can be really daunting to start therapy, especially when you're not sure what to expect. Can you tell me a bit more about what's been feeling overwhelming for you? Is it the thought of talking about certain things, or is it more about the idea of changing some habits or patterns in your life?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah, it's just that I've been carrying this weight of self-blame for so long, and it's hard for me to think about changing that. I feel like it's a part of who I am, and it's hard to imagine being someone else.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>I sense that you're carrying a lot of emotional weight with you, and it's no wonder that you're feeling overwhelmed. It takes a lot of courage to acknowledge and confront those feelings of self-blame. Can you help me understand what you mean by saying it's hard to imagine being someone else? What does that look like to you, and what kind of person do you think you would need to become in order to let go of some of that self-blame?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think I would need to become someone who's worthy of love and acceptance, even if they've made mistakes. Someone who can forgive themselves and stop beating themselves up over what could've been different if I was in a different foster care situation.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>I see. It sounds like you're saying that you've been carrying a lot of shame and self-criticism, and that you feel like you're not worthy of love and acceptance because of your past experiences. It's like you're holding onto the idea that if only you had been in a different foster care situation, you would be a better person and deserving of love. Can you explore with me what it would take for you to start believing that you are worthy of love and acceptance, regardless of your past or any perceived mistakes?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah, I can see how that makes sense. But the thing is, it's not just about me being worthy of love and acceptance. It's about me being worthy of forgiveness, too. I feel like I've been holding onto all this guilt and shame for so long, and it's hard to let go of that. It's like I'm stuck in this cycle of self-blame, and I don't know how to break free.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like the concept of forgiveness is a huge part of this for you, and that you're struggling to let go of the guilt and shame that you've been carrying. Can you help me understand what forgiveness would look like for you? Is it about forgiving yourself, forgiving others from your past, or something else entirely? What would it take for you to start the process of forgiving yourself, and what do you think would happen if you were able to do that?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think forgiving myself would mean acknowledging that I did the best I could with what I had at the time, and that I'm not to blame for everything that happened in my past. It's hard for me to accept that because I've been carrying this burden of self-blame for so long, but I can see how it would be liberating to let go of that guilt and shame.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Can you help me understand what would happen if you were to let go of that guilt and shame? What would your life look like if you were no longer carrying that burden of self-blame? What kind of person would you be, and what kind of relationships would you have?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>That's a really tough question, because I think I've been so used to carrying this burden that I'm not sure what it would be like to not have it. But I think if I were to let go of that guilt and shame, I would be a more compassionate and gentle person towards myself. I wouldn't be so hard on myself all the time, and I would be more open to receiving love and acceptance from others.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>I love that you're imagining a future self who is more compassionate and gentle towards yourself. It's beautiful to see you envisioning a life where you're not burdened by guilt and shame. Can you explore with me what it would take to start moving towards that vision? What small steps could you take to begin letting go of that burden, and what kind of support or resources might you need to make that happen?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think that's a great question. I can see how letting go of the guilt and shame would be liberating, but it's hard for me to imagine what that would look like in practice. I'm not sure what small steps I could take to start moving towards that vision.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're feeling a sense of hopelessness and uncertainty about how to move forward. It's like you're stuck in this cycle of self-blame and don't know how to break free. I want to acknowledge that it takes a lot of courage to even consider letting go of that guilt and shame, and that it's not something that can be done overnight. But I also want to encourage you that small steps can add up and lead to big changes over time. Can we explore some possible small steps you could take to start moving towards your vision of being a more compassionate and gentle person towards yourself? For example, what if you started by practicing self-compassion in small ways, like taking a few deep breaths and repeating a kind phrase to yourself each day? Or what if you started by writing down things you're grateful for each day, to help shift your focus away from guilt and shame and towards the present moment?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I like the idea of taking small steps towards self-compassion. I can try to focus on the present moment and practice being kind to myself. Maybe I can start by writing down three things I'm grateful for each day before going to bed. I think that would be a good way to start.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're feeling a sense of hopelessness and uncertainty about how to move forward, but you're also willing to take small steps towards self-compassion. I love that you're open to exploring some possible small steps we can take together. Writing down three things you're grateful for each day before bed is a great starting point. Can you imagine how that might feel to shift your focus away from guilt and shame and towards the present moment? How do you think that might impact your daily life and relationships?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>To be honest, I'm still trying to wrap my head around the idea of forgiving myself and letting go of this guilt and shame. It feels like a huge mountain to climb, and I'm not sure where to start. But I like the idea of taking small steps towards self-compassion, and I'm willing to try. Writing down three things I'm grateful for each day before bed feels like a manageable place to start.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're feeling a sense of trepidation about the idea of forgiving yourself and letting go of guilt and shame, but you're also willing to take small steps towards self-compassion. I want to acknowledge that this is a complex and challenging process, and it's okay if it feels overwhelming at times. Can we explore the idea that forgiving yourself is not about erasing the past or forgetting the pain you've experienced, but rather about acknowledging that you did the best you could with what you had at the time, and that you're not defined by those experiences? It's a process of re-framing your understanding of yourself and your past, and it can be a powerful way to break free from the cycle of self-blame.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I understand what you're saying, but it's hard for me to wrap my head around the idea of forgiving myself and letting go of the guilt and shame. It feels like I'm condoning my past mistakes and that I'm not taking responsibility for my actions. But at the same time, I can see how holding onto this guilt and shame is not serving me well and is causing me a lot of pain. I guess I'm just struggling to find a balance between taking responsibility for my actions and also being kind to myself.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>I completely understand your concerns about forgiving yourself and letting go of guilt and shame. It's natural to feel conflicted about this. It sounds like you're worried about condoning your past mistakes and not taking responsibility for your actions. Can you help me understand what it would mean to you to take responsibility for your actions? What does that look like in your mind, and how does that relate to your feelings of guilt and shame?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think taking responsibility for my actions means owning up to my mistakes and not making excuses for them. It means acknowledging that I did the best I could with what I had at the time, but also acknowledging that I could have done things differently. It's about being honest with myself and others about my role in the situation, and not trying to shift the blame onto someone else. I think that's a big part of why I've been carrying this guilt and shame for so long - I've been trying to convince myself and others that it wasn't my fault, and that's not true.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like taking responsibility for your actions is about being honest with yourself and others about your role in the situation, and acknowledging that you could have done things differently. That's a really important part of the process of forgiving yourself and moving forward. Can you imagine what it would be like to hold onto that sense of responsibility, but also to let go of the guilt and shame that's been weighing you down? How do you think that would feel, and what kind of impact do you think it would have on your daily life and relationships?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think it would feel incredibly liberating to let go of the guilt and shame and still be able to acknowledge my responsibility for my actions. It's like I would be breaking free from this cycle of self-blame and self-criticism, and I would be able to move forward with a sense of clarity and purpose. I think it would also allow me to have more authentic and meaningful relationships with others, because I wouldn't be carrying around this weight of guilt and shame all the time.</div>

It's like I'm starting to recognize that I'm not just a victim of my circumstances, but also a person who has the power to choose how I respond to them.

But it's also important to recognize that your worth and value as a person are not defined by your past experiences or your perceived mistakes. You are a complex and multifaceted person with strengths, weaknesses, and experiences that are unique to you. It's okay to acknowledge your mistakes and the pain you've experienced, but it's also important to recognize that you are more than your past.
