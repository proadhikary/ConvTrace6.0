                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Hi Carolyn, it’s nice to meet you. How are you feeling today?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>It’s just been really tough. I keep doubting my skills and feeling like I’m not good enough, especially after that critic’s review and the feedback from my colleagues. I’m starting to lose my passion for cooking.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>I'm so sorry to hear that, Carolyn. It sounds like you're really struggling with self-doubt and uncertainty right now. Can you tell me more about what's been going through your mind since that review and the feedback from your colleagues? What's been the most troubling or distressing part of it for you?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah, it's just been really tough to deal with. I feel like my whole identity as a chef is being questioned. The critic's review was like a punch in the gut, and the feedback from my colleagues just confirms what I'm already thinking - that I'm not good enough. It's like I'm constantly second-guessing myself and wondering if I'm just pretending to be a good chef. And the worst part is, I don't know how to shake this feeling off.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like the criticism and feedback have really shaken your confidence in your abilities as a chef. It's understandable that you're feeling like your identity is being questioned. Can you tell me more about what you mean by pretending to be a good chef? What does that feel like for you, and how does it manifest in your daily life and cooking?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>It's like, I don't know, it's like I'm just going through the motions, pretending to be a good chef, but deep down, I know I'm not good enough. It's like I'm living a lie, and it's eating away at me. I feel like I'm constantly trying to prove myself to others, but I don't know if I can even prove it to myself. It's like I'm stuck in this loop of self-doubt and uncertainty, and I don't know how to break free from it.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're experiencing a sense of inauthenticity and disconnection from your true self and abilities as a chef. You're feeling like you're just going through the motions, pretending to be someone you're not, and that's causing a lot of distress and anxiety for you. Can you tell me more about what you think you'd need to feel more authentic and confident in your abilities as a chef? What would it take for you to shake off this sense of pretence and be able to cook with more freedom and joy?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah, it's hard to even imagine a scenario where I can be confident in my cooking again. I feel like I've lost that sense of passion and enjoyment I used to get from cooking. It's like I'm just going through the motions now, and it's sucking the life out of me.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're feeling a sense of disconnection from your passion and joy for cooking, and that's causing a lot of distress for you. Can you help me understand what you think you'd need to get that passion and joy back? Is it about reconnecting with your love for the craft, or is it about proving something to yourself or others?</div>

                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I don't know, it's like I've lost my sense of purpose and meaning in cooking. It's not just about being good at it, it's about being passionate about it and enjoying the process. I feel like I've lost that sense of joy and freedom in the kitchen, and it's really hard for me to imagine getting it back.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're feeling a sense of emptiness and disconnection from your passion for cooking, and that's causing a lot of distress for you. It's not just about being good at it, but about feeling a sense of purpose and meaning in what you do. Can we explore this idea of purpose and meaning in your cooking? What did you love about cooking when you first started, and how has that changed over time? Are there any moments or experiences that still bring you joy and fulfillment in the kitchen?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think about the times when I used to cook for my friends and family, and they would just rave about my dishes. It was like I was creating something special, and it brought me so much joy. But now, every time I cook, I'm just thinking about what could go wrong, and it's taking away from the enjoyment of the process. I feel like I've lost that sense of creativity and freedom in the kitchen, and it's hard for me to imagine getting it back.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you've lost touch with the joy and passion you once had for cooking, and that's causing a lot of pain and disconnection for you. Can we explore what you think is missing from your cooking experience now that's causing you to feel so stuck and uncertain? Is it the sense of creativity, the connection with others, or something else entirely?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think it's the sense of creativity that's missing. When I was first starting out, I loved experimenting with new recipes and techniques, and it was like a puzzle to solve. But now, every time I cook, I'm just following a recipe to the letter, and it's so boring. I feel like I've lost that sense of creativity and freedom in the kitchen, and it's hard for me to imagine getting it back.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're feeling a sense of stagnation and routine in your cooking, and that's taking away from the joy and passion you once had for it. You're describing a sense of loss of creativity and freedom in the kitchen, and that's causing a lot of distress for you. Can we explore ways to help you reignite that sense of creativity and experimentation in your cooking? What do you think would help you get back to that place where you're excited to try new recipes and techniques?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I feel like I've been stuck in this rut for so long, and I don't know how to get out of it. I keep thinking about all the things I could have done differently, and it's like I'm reliving the whole experience over and over again. I just wish I could go back in time and do things differently, but I know that's not possible.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're feeling really stuck and uncertain about your cooking, and that's causing a lot of pain and disconnection for you. It's understandable that you're replaying the criticism and feedback in your mind, but it's also causing you to feel like you're stuck in a rut and can't move forward. Can we explore ways to help you let go of the what ifs and focus on what you can control right now? Instead of dwelling on what you could have done differently, what if we focus on what you can do differently in the present moment to reignite your passion and creativity in the kitchen?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I'm starting to feel like I'm never going to be able to shake off this feeling of inadequacy and self-doubt. It's like I'm trapped in this cycle of negative thoughts and emotions, and I don't know how to escape it. I feel like I'm losing myself and my passion for cooking, and it's really scary.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're feeling really stuck and trapped in a cycle of negative thoughts and emotions. It's understandable that you're struggling with self-doubt and feelings of inadequacy, especially given the recent criticism and feedback. However, I want to gently encourage you that you are not defined by this one experience or the opinions of others. You are so much more than this one moment in time. What if we start to explore ways to help you build back your confidence and sense of purpose in the kitchen? What if we focus on small, incremental steps that you can take to reignite your passion and creativity? Instead of getting caught up in the what ifs and regrets, what if we focus on what you can control right now? We can start to explore small changes you can make to your cooking routine, or even just small moments of self-care that can help you feel more grounded and centered. Would you be open to exploring some of these ideas with me?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah, I guess so. I mean, it's not like I have anything to lose at this point, right? I'm already feeling so stuck and trapped in this cycle of negative thoughts and emotions. But at the same time, I'm scared of trying something new or taking a risk, because what if it doesn't work out? What if I fail again?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're feeling really uncertain and fearful about trying something new, and that's understandable given the recent criticism and feedback. However, I want to gently encourage you that taking small risks and trying new things can actually be a powerful way to build back your confidence and sense of purpose. It's not about guaranteeing success, but about taking small steps towards growth and exploration. What if we brainstorm some small, low-stakes changes you could make to your cooking routine that would allow you to take a risk and try something new? This could be as simple as trying a new recipe, cooking for a different audience, or experimenting with a new ingredient. By taking small steps, you can start to build back your confidence and sense of control in the kitchen. Would you be open to exploring some ideas with me?</div>
