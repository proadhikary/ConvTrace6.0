                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>** I'm glad to hear that. Remember, this is a journey, and it's okay to take it one step at a time. You're not alone in this, and together, we'll work on building that more balanced and compassionate view of yourself.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Thank you. I understand that this is a process, and I'm ready to take it step by step. Could you tell me more about the techniques we'll be using to address my negative beliefs?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>I'm glad you're interested in learning more about the techniques we'll be using. One approach we can take is to practice reframing your negative beliefs. This involves identifying the negative thought patterns and replacing them with more balanced and compassionate ones. For example, instead of thinking I'm a failure because I didn't get the job, we could reframe it as I didn't get the job, but I learned a lot from the experience and I'm one step closer to finding the right opportunity. By reframing your thoughts, you can start to challenge those negative beliefs and develop a more positive and compassionate view of yourself.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>That makes sense. I like the idea of reframing my negative thoughts. Can you help me identify some of the negative thought patterns I have about being a failure in marriage?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>To identify these negative thought patterns, let's try to trace back the thoughts that come up when you think about being a failure in marriage. Can you tell me more about what specifically comes up for you when you think about this? What are some of the thoughts, feelings, and images that arise?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I can feel my stomach dropping and my mind racing when I think about being a failure in marriage. I start thinking that I'm not good enough, that I'm flawed, and that I'll never be able to make it work. I imagine my ex-husbands judging me, thinking that I'm not worthy of love and commitment. These thoughts make me feel ashamed, guilty, and worthless. It's like I'm stuck in this endless cycle of self-doubt and self-blame.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like when you think about being a failure in marriage, you experience a lot of intense emotional arousal, including feelings of shame, guilt, and worthlessness. These thoughts and emotions can be really overwhelming and it's no wonder that you feel stuck in this cycle of self-doubt and self-blame. Can you try to identify any common themes or patterns in these thoughts? Are there any specific words or phrases that stand out to you, or any particular situations or events that trigger these thoughts?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think I can identify some common themes and patterns in these thoughts. I notice that I often focus on my perceived flaws and shortcomings, and that I tend to catastrophize and assume the worst about myself and others. I also notice that I often replay past failures and mistakes in my mind, reliving the shame and guilt associated with those experiences. Additionally, I think I may be overly critical of myself and others, and that I often have unrealistic expectations about what a successful marriage should look like.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're able to identify some common themes and patterns in your negative thought patterns around being a failure in marriage. It's interesting that you notice a focus on perceived flaws and shortcomings, catastrophizing, and replaying past failures. This can be a good starting point for us to work with. Can you tell me more about what you think might be driving these patterns? Is there anything in your past experiences or relationships that might be contributing to these negative thought patterns?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>That's a great question, and I think I can see how my past experiences and relationships might be contributing to these negative thought patterns. For instance, I grew up in a family where my parents were always criticizing and judging me, and I think that's where I learned to be overly critical of myself and others. Additionally, my past marriages were often marked by conflict and criticism, which reinforced my negative beliefs about myself as a spouse. I think these experiences have led me to develop a negative self-image and a fear of being judged or rejected.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like your past experiences, particularly your childhood and past relationships, have had a significant impact on your negative thought patterns and self-image. It's not surprising that you've developed a negative self-image and a fear of being judged or rejected. Can you tell me more about how you think these experiences have shaped your sense of self and your relationships? What are some specific memories or moments that stand out to you as particularly influential in shaping your negative thought patterns?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think recognizing the patterns and themes in my negative thought patterns is already helping me to see that my negative beliefs about myself aren't entirely accurate. I'm starting to realize that I'm not a failure in marriage just because I've been divorced multiple times. It's like, I've had four chances to learn and grow, and I've learned so much from each experience. Maybe instead of focusing on what went wrong, I can focus on what I've learned and how I've grown.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're already starting to see that your negative beliefs about yourself might not be entirely accurate. That's a great step forward! It's amazing that you're able to recognize the patterns and themes in your negative thought patterns and how they might be driven by your past experiences. By focusing on what you've learned and how you've grown from each experience, you can start to challenge those negative beliefs and develop a more compassionate and balanced view of yourself. Can you tell me more about what you think it would take for you to start to shift your focus away from what went wrong and towards what you've learned and grown from each experience?</div>

                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're already making some significant progress in recognizing the patterns and themes in your negative thought patterns and how they might be driven by your past experiences.

                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're starting to connect the dots between your negative thought patterns and your past experiences.

                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think letting go of those negative thoughts and emotions would be incredibly liberating. It would mean that I'm no longer held back by the weight of shame and guilt, and I could start to focus on the present moment and my future. I imagine it would feel like a huge burden has been lifted off my shoulders, and I could start to move forward with a sense of hope and optimism. I would be able to see myself and my experiences in a more balanced and compassionate light, and I wouldn't be so hard on myself. I would be able to focus on what I've learned and grown from each experience, and use those lessons to move forward in a positive way.</div>
