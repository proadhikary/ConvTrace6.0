                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Hi Derek, I'm glad you decided to reach out. Can you tell me what brings you in today?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I've been feeling really stressed and overwhelmed about not spending every moment preparing for college. I feel guilty when I take breaks, and it's getting exhausting.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Can you tell me more about what's driving this pressure to constantly prepare for college? Is there something specific that's making you feel like you need to be constantly studying or preparing?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Ah, yeah, I think it's just this internalized expectation to excel and make my parents proud. I've always been told that I need to work hard to achieve success, and now that I'm about to start college, I feel like I need to be even more prepared. But honestly, it's exhausting me, and I'm starting to wonder if all this stress is really worth it.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Can you help me understand what you mean by making your parents proud? Is it just a general sense that they'll be happy with your accomplishments, or is there something more to it? Are you worried that if you don't meet their expectations, they'll be disappointed or even embarrassed by you?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>That's a great question, and it's something that's been bothering me a lot lately. I think it's a mix of both - wanting to make them proud and also fearing their disappointment. I've always been a high achiever, and I've been led to believe that it's the key to success. But now that I'm about to start college, I'm starting to wonder if this constant pressure is really worth it.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're carrying a lot of weight on your shoulders, trying to live up to your own expectations and your parents' expectations. Can you explore with me what would happen if you didn't meet these expectations? What would that look like, and how would that affect your relationship with your parents?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>That's a really tough thing to think about, to be honest. I'm not sure what would happen if I didn't meet their expectations. I'm afraid that they would be disappointed, maybe even embarrassed by me. But at the same time, I'm starting to realize that their expectations are not necessarily my own. I'm starting to wonder if I'm just trying to live up to someone else's idea of success, rather than my own.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're carrying a lot of uncertainty and fear around what others might think of you, and that's causing a lot of stress and anxiety for you. Can you help me explore this idea of living up to someone else's idea of success? What does that look like for you, and how does that compare to what you want for yourself?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think I'm really struggling with the idea that I've always defined my self-worth by how well I do academically. If I don't meet my parents' expectations, I feel like I'm failing as a person. But at the same time, I'm starting to realize that I want to define my own success, not just based on grades or achievements. I want to focus on what brings me joy and fulfillment, rather than just trying to please others.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're at a crossroads, trying to figure out what success means to you and how to prioritize your own happiness and fulfillment. It's amazing that you're recognizing the importance of living authentically and not just trying to meet others' expectations. Can you help me explore what specifically brings you joy and fulfillment? Are there any activities, hobbies, or passions that you've been putting aside because you've been so focused on preparing for college?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>That's a great question, and one that I've been struggling with lately. I used to love playing guitar and writing music, but I haven't had time for it since high school. I think what brings me joy is creating something from nothing, and music allows me to do that. I've also been thinking about joining a club or organization on campus that aligns with my interests, maybe something related to music or creative writing. But the thing is, I'm scared to make time for these things, because I think my parents will be disappointed if I'm not focusing on my studies.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're feeling trapped between pleasing others and pursuing your own passions. You're worried that if you make time for things that bring you joy, your parents will be disappointed and think you're not taking your studies seriously enough. Can you explore with me what would happen if you did make time for these things? Would you be able to find a way to balance your academic responsibilities with your own interests and passions? And what do you think would happen if your parents did express disappointment? Would it be worth it to you to take a stand and prioritize your own happiness and fulfillment?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think I'm really scared to take the leap and make time for my own interests, because I've always prioritized pleasing others. But at the same time, I'm starting to realize that if I don't take care of myself and pursue what brings me joy, I'll continue to feel burnt out and unhappy. I want to find a way to balance my academic responsibilities with my own passions, but I'm not sure how to do that without feeling guilty or like I'm letting my parents down.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're feeling a sense of duty to your parents, and that's causing you a lot of internal conflict. You're worried about letting them down if you prioritize your own interests and passions. Can you help me understand what you think would happen if you did let them down? Would they actually be disappointed, or is that just a fear that's driving your behavior?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think that's a valid point, counselor. I'm not sure what would happen if I didn't meet their expectations, but I'm starting to realize that their expectations are not necessarily my own. I'm starting to wonder if I'm just trying to live up to someone else's idea of success, rather than my own.</div>

                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think that's a great point, counselor. I've been so focused on meeting my parents' expectations that I haven't really considered what I want for myself. I've been living on autopilot, trying to be the person they want me to be rather than the person I am. It's scary to think about not meeting their expectations, but at the same time, it's also kind of empowering to realize that I don't have to live up to someone else's idea of success. I want to start exploring what brings me joy and fulfillment, and not just trying to please others.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're feeling a sense of liberation and empowerment as you start to realize that you don't have to live up to someone else's idea of success. Can you help me understand what it would take for you to start making decisions that align with your own values and desires, rather than just trying to please others? What kind of support system would you need to have in place in order to feel confident in your choices?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think I'm starting to realize that I've been living on autopilot, trying to meet everyone else's expectations without really considering what I want for myself. It's scary to think about not meeting my parents' expectations, but at the same time, it's also kind of empowering to realize that I don't have to live up to someone else's idea of success. I want to start exploring what brings me joy and fulfillment, and not just trying to please others.</div>

                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think what would help me make decisions that align with my own values and desires is to have a support system in place that understands and validates my feelings. I need people who can help me see that I don't have to live up to someone else's idea of success, and that it's okay to take risks and make choices that are right for me. I also need to work on building my own self-confidence and self-worth, so that I can trust myself to make good decisions.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're recognizing the importance of having a supportive network and building your own self-confidence to make decisions that align with your values and desires. Can you help me understand what specific actions you would need to take to build this support system and increase your self-confidence? Are there any small steps you could take in the next week or two to start moving towards this goal?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think I need to start by prioritizing my own needs and desires, rather than just trying to please others. I need to make time for the things that bring me joy and fulfillment, like playing guitar and writing music. I also need to practice self-compassion and remind myself that it's okay to make mistakes and take risks. I'll try to set aside some time each week to focus on my own goals and interests, and I'll work on building a support system by talking to my friends and family about what I'm going through.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're taking a big step towards recognizing the importance of prioritizing your own needs and desires. What specific strategies can you use to prioritize your own needs, especially when it feels like others are expecting you to focus on their expectations?

                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think that's a great question, counselor. I've been struggling with setting boundaries and prioritizing my own needs when it feels like others are expecting me to do something that doesn't align with my values or desires. I've been trying to please everyone else, and it's left me feeling drained and unfulfilled. I want to learn how to communicate my needs effectively and set boundaries in a way that is respectful to others, while also being true to myself.</div>
