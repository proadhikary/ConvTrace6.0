                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Hello Amanda, welcome. How are you feeling today?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I'm feeling a bit anxious, but Iâ€™m looking forward to talking. I really want to address how my self-doubt and feelings of inadequacy are affecting my enjoyment of outdoor activities, especially since the car accident.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>I'm so sorry to hear about the car accident, Amanda. It sounds like the experience has really impacted your confidence and enjoyment of things you used to love. Can you tell me more about what happened during the accident and how it's been affecting your self-doubt and feelings of inadequacy?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah, it was a pretty tough experience. I was driving home from a party and lost control of the car, which resulted in me losing my arm. Since then, I've been struggling with feelings of inadequacy and self-doubt, especially when it comes to outdoor activities. I feel like I'm not the same person I used to be, and it's hard for me to reconcile the accident with my identity.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>I'm so sorry to hear about the loss of your arm, Amanda. It's no wonder that the accident has had a significant impact on your sense of self and confidence. It sounds like you're struggling to come to terms with the new reality and the changes it has brought to your life. Can you tell me more about what specifically is making you feel like you're not the same person you used to be? Is it the physical changes, the limitations it's brought to your activities, or something else entirely?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah, it's a combination of everything, I think. The physical changes are definitely a big part of it, but it's also the emotional toll of the accident. I feel like I've lost a part of myself, and it's hard to reconcile that with who I used to be.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Amanda, it sounds like the accident has had a profound impact on your sense of identity and self-concept. The loss of a body part can be a devastating experience, and it's no wonder that you're struggling to come to terms with the changes it has brought to your life. Can you tell me more about what you mean by 'a part of myself'? What specifically do you feel like you've lost, and how do you think that's affecting your sense of who you are?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Client:</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Amanda, when you say 'a part of myself', I sense that you're not just referring to the physical loss of your arm, but also the sense of ability, confidence, and capability that came with it. It's as if you're feeling like you've lost a part of your identity that was deeply tied to your outdoor activities and sense of self. Am I getting close to what you're trying to convey?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>That's exactly right, counselor. I feel like I've lost a part of myself that was connected to my sense of adventure and capability. I used to be able to do so many things outdoors, and now I feel like I'm limited in so many ways. It's hard for me to reconcile the person I used to be with the person I am now, and that's causing me a lot of distress.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like the loss of your arm has not just been a physical loss, but also an emotional and identity-related one. It's as if you're grieving the loss of a part of yourself that was deeply tied to your sense of adventure, capability, and identity. Can you tell me more about what you think the person you used to be would say to you now, about your current situation and feelings of inadequacy?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Client:</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Amanda, it sounds like the person you used to be would probably say something like, I know you're struggling to come to terms with the new reality, but you're still the same person I always was. You're strong, capable, and adventurous, and you can find ways to adapt and thrive in this new situation. What do you think about that? Does that resonate with you, or do you think the person you used to be would say something different?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah, that resonates with me a lot. I think the person I used to be would definitely encourage me to adapt and find new ways to enjoy the outdoors, even if it's not exactly the same as before.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like the person you used to be would be a source of encouragement and support for you right now, and would help you to focus on your strengths and abilities rather than your limitations. It's interesting that you're able to connect with that part of yourself and hear their words of wisdom. Can you tell me more about what you think it would take for you to start embracing your new reality and finding ways to adapt and thrive in this new situation?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think it would take me acknowledging that I'm not the same person I used to be, but that I'm still capable of finding new ways to enjoy the outdoors. It's hard for me to let go of the idea that I'll never be able to do things the same way again, but I think if I can focus on the things I can still do, it would help me feel more confident and capable.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're already taking the first steps towards acceptance and adaptation, Amanda. Acknowledging that you're not the same person you used to be can be a tough but important step. What do you think would happen if you were to let go of the idea that you'll never be able to do things the same way again? Would you feel a sense of freedom or relief, or is there still some part of you that's holding onto that idea for reasons?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>That's a good question, counselor. I think if I were to let go of the idea that I'll never be able to do things the same way again, I would feel a sense of relief and freedom. I would be able to focus on the things I can still do and find new ways to enjoy the outdoors, rather than constantly comparing myself to my past self. It's hard for me to let go of that idea because it's a big part of my identity, but I think it's something I need to work towards in order to move forward.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Amanda, it sounds like you're recognizing that letting go of the idea of being able to do things the same way again is a crucial step towards embracing your new reality and finding ways to adapt and thrive. What do you think would be the most challenging part of letting go of that idea, and what strategies or support systems do you think you would need to help you through that process?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think the most challenging part of letting go of the idea of being able to do things the same way again would be accepting that I'm not the same person I used to be, and that I'll never be able to fully regain the abilities and confidence I had before the accident. It's hard for me to confront the reality that I've lost a part of myself, and it's scary to think about what the future might hold. I think I would need a lot of emotional support and encouragement from loved ones and perhaps even a therapist to help me work through these feelings.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Amanda, it sounds like you're acknowledging that letting go of the idea of being able to do things the same way again would require a significant shift in your perspective and identity. It's understandable that this would be a challenging process, especially given the strong tie between your sense of self and your outdoor activities. What do you think about exploring ways to rebuild your sense of identity and confidence in your new reality, rather than focusing on regaining what you had before?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>That's a really interesting perspective, counselor. I think exploring ways to rebuild my sense of identity and confidence in my new reality could be a great way for me to move forward and find a sense of purpose again. I know it's not the same as being able to do things the same way again, but I think it could be a way for me to find a new sense of meaning and fulfillment.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Amanda, I can sense that you're starting to open up to the possibility of rebuilding your sense of identity and confidence in your new reality. It's a courageous and forward-thinking approach, and I'm curious to explore this further with you. Can you tell me more about what you mean by finding a new sense of meaning and fulfillment? What kind of activities, hobbies, or passions do you think might help you achieve that?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think finding a new sense of meaning and fulfillment could come from exploring new outdoor activities that I can adapt to, even if they're not exactly the same as the ones I used to do. For example, I've always been interested in photography, and I think I could use a camera to capture the beauty of nature in a new way. I also think I could try adaptive sports, like kayaking or sailing, which would allow me to still enjoy being on the water but in a different way.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Amanda, it sounds like you're really starting to explore some exciting possibilities for rebuilding your sense of identity and confidence in your new reality. I love the idea of using photography as a way to connect with nature and find a new sense of purpose. And adaptive sports can be an amazing way to stay active and engaged with the outdoors while also acknowledging your new limitations. Can you tell me more about what draws you to photography, and how you think it might help you find a new sense of meaning and fulfillment?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think what draws me to photography is the idea of capturing the beauty of the world around me in a new way. As someone who used to enjoy hiking and outdoor activities, I've always been drawn to the natural world and the way it can evoke emotions and feelings of wonder. With photography, I think I can still connect with that sense of awe and appreciation for nature, even if I'm not able to do the same physical activities as before.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Amanda, it sounds like photography could be a powerful way for you to reconnect with nature and find a new sense of purpose. By capturing the beauty of the world around you, you may be able to tap into that sense of awe and wonder that you used to experience through your outdoor activities. How do you think you might feel if you were to take your camera with you on outings and capture the natural world through your lens? Would that help you feel more connected to the outdoors and more fulfilled?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think that would be amazing, counselor. I can already imagine the sense of excitement and wonder I would feel if I were to capture the beauty of nature through my camera lens. It would be a way for me to still experience the outdoors and connect with nature, even if I'm not able to do the same physical activities as before. And I think it would also help me to focus on the present moment and appreciate the beauty around me, rather than constantly comparing myself to my past self.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're really excited about the possibility of using photography as a way to connect with nature and find a new sense of purpose. And I am too, Amanda. I think it's a great way for you to tap into that sense of awe and wonder that you used to experience through your outdoor activities. By capturing the beauty of the world around you, you may be able to find a new way to feel connected to the outdoors and more fulfilled.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think I'm starting to see a glimmer of hope here, counselor. The idea of using photography as a way to connect with nature and find a new sense of purpose is really appealing to me. I can imagine myself taking my camera with me on outings and capturing the beauty of the world around me. It's a way for me to still experience the outdoors and connect with nature, even if I'm not able to do the same physical activities as before. And I think it would also help me to focus on the present moment and appreciate the beauty around me, rather than constantly comparing myself to my past self.</div>

I think what I'm trying to say is that I'm ready to start letting go of the idea that I'll never be able to do things the same way again, and instead, focus on finding new ways to enjoy the outdoors and connect with nature.
