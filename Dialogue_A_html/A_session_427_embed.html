                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Hi Kayla, it's nice to meet you. I'm looking forward to our session today. Can you tell me a bit about what's bringing you here?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I've been working at the grocery store for three years now, and every time I get my paycheck, I try to budget for moving out, but it just feels impossible. It's frustrating to see people around my age being able to live on their own while I feel stuck.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>I can sense your frustration and disappointment. It sounds like you're really striving for independence and autonomy, but the financial aspects of achieving that goal are proving to be a significant challenge for you. Can you help me understand what specifically is making it feel impossible for you to budget for moving out? Is it the amount of money you're making, the expenses you're incured, or something else entirely?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah, it's just that my salary is really low, and the cost of living on my own is so high. I feel like I'm barely scraping by as it is, and the thought of trying to save up for a place of my own feels like an insurmountable task. And to make matters worse, my friends are all moving out and starting their own lives, and it's just really hard to see that and feel like I'm stuck in this rut.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like the low salary and high cost of living are significant barriers for you, making it really tough to save up for independence. And it's also tough to see your friends moving on with their lives, which can amplify those feelings of being stuck. Can you tell me more about what it's like for you to feel like you're barely scraping by? What are some of the daily or weekly expenses that are giving you the most trouble?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>It's just the usual stuff, like rent, utilities, food, transportation... everything adds up so quickly. And then there's the unexpected expenses that always seem to come out of nowhere, like car repairs or medical bills. It feels like no matter how hard I try to budget, I'm always just one step behind. And to make matters worse, my parents are always offering to help me out, which I appreciate, but it's hard not to feel like I'm relying on them too much. It's like, I want to be independent, but it's hard to see that happening anytime soon.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're feeling a bit overwhelmed by the daily expenses and the uncertainty of unexpected costs, which can make it really tough to make progress towards your goal of moving out. And on top of that, you're also struggling with the sense of reliance on your parents, which can be tough for you because you want to be independent. Can you tell me more about what it's like for you to feel like you're relying on your parents? Is it hard for you to accept their help, or is it more that you're worried about not being able to take care of yourself?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah, it's just really hard for me to accept their help because I feel like I should be able to take care of myself. I don't want to be a burden on them, and I'm worried that if I keep relying on them, I'll never be able to move out. But at the same time, it's hard for me to say no to their help because I know they're trying to support me. It's like, I want to be independent, but I also don't want to let them down. It's a really tough spot for me to be in.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're caught in this complex web of feelings and concerns around accepting help from your parents, and it's really struggling with the desire for independence and the fear of being a burden. It's understandable that you want to be able to take care of yourself, but it's also important to recognize that it's okay to accept help from others when you need it. Can you explore with me what would make it feel more okay for you to accept their help, or what would need to change in your relationship with your parents for you to feel more comfortable with this?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think what would make it feel more okay for me to accept their help is if I felt like I was making progress towards moving out. Like, if I was taking steps towards independence, even if it's slow, I would feel more comfortable accepting their help because I would know that I'm working towards a goal. But right now, it feels like I'm just stuck in this rut and I'm not making any progress, which makes it hard for me to accept their help because I feel like I'm not doing anything to deserve it.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're really struggling with the sense of stagnation and lack of progress towards your goal of moving out, which is making it hard for you to accept help from your parents. You're wanting to feel like you're taking active steps towards independence, and that would make it feel more okay for you to accept their support. Can you help me understand what kind of steps you think you would need to take in order to feel like you're making progress towards moving out? Are there any specific actions or decisions you need to make in order to feel like you're moving in the right direction?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah, I think I need to start by looking at my budget more closely and seeing where I can cut back on expenses. Maybe there are some things I'm spending money on that aren't necessary. I've also been thinking about taking on a side job or finding ways to increase my income. And maybe I can look into finding a roommate or sharing an apartment with someone else to split the cost. It's just hard to know where to start and what the best decisions are for me.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're thinking about taking a more active role in managing your finances and exploring ways to increase your income, which could help you feel more in control and like you're making progress towards moving out. Can you tell me more about what's holding you back from taking these steps already? Is it feeling overwhelmed by the process, or is there something else that's keeping you from taking action?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think I've been putting it off because I feel like I don't know where to start. I've been trying to make changes on my own, but it feels like no matter what I do, I'm not making any progress. And then there's also the fear of failing, which is holding me back. What if I take on a side job and it doesn't work out, or what if I cut back on expenses and it's not enough? The uncertainty of it all is really paralyzing for me.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're feeling a bit stuck and uncertain about how to move forward with your goal of moving out. You're worried about taking on a side job and it not working out, or cutting back on expenses and it not being enough. It's like you're feeling really overwhelmed by the possibilities and uncertainties. Can you help me understand what would happen if you did take one small step towards making a change? What would be the worst that could happen, and what would be the best? Maybe we can break it down together and make a plan for you to take a small step towards your goal.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think I need to start small, you know? Maybe I can start by just tracking my expenses for a week or two to see where I can cut back. It feels like a small step, but it might be a good way to get started. And maybe I can also look into some side jobs or freelance work that I can do on the weekends or nights. It's not a lot, but it's something, and it might help me feel more in control of my finances.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like taking small steps towards managing your finances and exploring ways to increase your income could be a great way for you to start feeling more in control and like you're making progress towards moving out. Can you help me understand what's drawing you to the idea of starting small, and what you think might happen if you took this approach?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah, I think I need to start by focusing on the things that I can control, like my budget and my expenses. By making small changes, I can start to feel more empowered and in control of my finances. It's not about making a huge change all at once, but about taking small steps towards independence. And who knows, maybe one small step will lead to another, and I'll start to feel like I'm making progress towards moving out.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're really recognizing the importance of taking small steps towards your goal of moving out, and that's a great approach.

What do you think would happen if you took this approach and started tracking your expenses and looking into side jobs or freelance work?

                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think I would feel a sense of accomplishment and momentum if I took this approach. It would be a small step towards moving out, and it would give me a sense of control over my finances. I'm worried that if I don't take control of my finances, I'll never be able to move out and I'll be stuck in this rut forever.</div>

                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think I'm feeling a bit overwhelmed by the whole situation, and starting small seems like a way to break it down and make it more manageable. I'm worried that if I try to make big changes all at once, I'll get discouraged and give up. But if I start with small steps, I might be more likely to make progress and feel a sense of accomplishment.</div>
