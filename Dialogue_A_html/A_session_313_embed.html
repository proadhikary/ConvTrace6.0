                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Hi Gerald, welcome to the session. I appreciate your willingness to seek counseling. How can I support you today?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think it might be a fear of wasting time on a story that doesn't end well. I've tried focusing on the positive aspects, but the endings always overshadow everything.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Can you tell me more about what you mean by the endings always overshadowing everything? What specific things come to mind when you think about the endings of stories that make you feel like you're wasting time?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Honestly, I think it's because I invest so much of myself in the stories, emotionally and mentally. I start to care about the characters and the world they're in, and when the ending doesn't meet my expectations, it feels like all that emotional investment was wasted. It's like I'm left feeling empty and unsatisfied, like I've been let down by the author.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>I see. It sounds like you have a strong connection with the characters and world in the stories you read, and when the ending doesn't meet your expectations, it can feel like you've lost something valuable. Can you help me understand what kind of endings specifically leave you feeling let down or unhappy? Is it a particular author or genre that tends to disappoint you, or is it more of a general feeling you get from most stories?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah, I think it's a mix of both. I've had experiences with certain authors or genres that really let me down, but it's also the general feeling I get when I finish a book. It's like I'm always expecting something amazing, and when it doesn't happen, I feel like I've been robbed of that experience.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Can you help me understand what you mean by something amazing? What specifically are you hoping for in a story's ending that would make it feel like you've gotten what you wanted? Is it a sense of resolution, a happy ending, or something else entirely?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think what I'm looking for is a sense of satisfaction, like the ending ties everything together and leaves me feeling fulfilled. Maybe it's the feeling of closure, knowing that the characters have grown and changed in a meaningful way. When the ending doesn't deliver that, it feels like I've invested all this time and energy into nothing.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're seeking a sense of completion and fulfillment from the stories you read, where the ending provides a sense of resolution and growth for the characters. Can you help me understand what you think would happen if you were to accept that not every story can deliver that sense of satisfaction? Would you be able to still enjoy the experience of reading, even if the ending doesn't meet your expectations, or would you feel like you've lost something important?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think if I could accept that not every story can deliver that sense of satisfaction, I might be able to still enjoy the experience of reading. Maybe I could focus on the positive aspects of the story, like the characters and world-building, rather than the ending. It's hard for me to imagine right now, but I suppose it's worth a try.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're willing to explore the idea of accepting that not every story can meet your expectations. That's a big step! What do you think would be the most challenging part of letting go of the need for a satisfying ending? Would you feel like you're giving up on something important, or is it more about recognizing that your expectations might be unrealistic?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think the most challenging part would be acknowledging that I'm holding onto these expectations because of a fear of being let down or disappointed. It's like I'm trying to protect myself from feeling that sense of emptiness or unsatisfaction.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're trying to protect yourself from feelings of disappointment and emptiness by holding onto these expectations. Can you explore with me what would happen if you were to let go of that need for protection and allow yourself to experience the disappointment or emptiness without judgment? Would you be able to acknowledge and accept those feelings without trying to avoid or distract yourself from them?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think it's going to be tough for me to let go of the need for a satisfying ending because it's become a habit for me to expect that from the stories I read. I've been doing it for so long that it feels like a part of who I am, and it's hard to imagine changing that.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're concerned about losing a part of yourself or your identity that's tied to this need for a satisfying ending. Can you help me understand what you think would happen if you were to let go of that need and explore what's beneath it? Is there something specific that you're afraid of losing or not getting from the stories you read?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I guess what I'm scared of is that if I let go of this need for a satisfying ending, I'll lose the sense of emotional investment I have in the stories. I'll feel like I'm not connecting with the characters and world-building as deeply, and that will make the experience of reading less enjoyable for me.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're worried that letting go of this need for a satisfying ending will somehow diminish the emotional connection you feel with the stories you read. Can you help me understand what you mean by emotional investment and how you think it's tied to your need for a satisfying ending? Is it about feeling like you're a part of the story or that the characters are a part of you?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think it's interesting that I've been able to connect with the characters and world-building so deeply, but at the same time, I've been holding onto this need for a satisfying ending. It's like I'm torn between the joy of experiencing the story and the fear of being let down by the ending.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It seems like you're struggling with a sense of dualism, where you're pitted against the stories you read, and the endings in particular. You feel like you're investing a lot of yourself in the stories, emotionally and mentally, and when the endings don't meet your expectations, it feels like you've lost something valuable. But at the same time, you're also acknowledging that this need for a satisfying ending might be holding you back from fully enjoying the experience of reading. Can we explore this idea of emotional investment further? What do you think would happen if you were to focus more on the process of reading, rather than the outcome, and allow yourself to be present in the moment, without trying to control or predict the ending?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think I'm starting to realize that my fear of being let down by the ending is actually rooted in a deeper fear of loss and disappointment in general. It's like I'm holding onto this need for a satisfying ending as a way to protect myself from feeling empty or unsatisfied, but in doing so, I'm actually preventing myself from fully experiencing the joy and satisfaction that reading can bring.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're starting to uncover some deeper fears and dynamics at play here. It's interesting that you're connecting your need for a satisfying ending to a deeper fear of loss and disappointment. Can you help me understand what you think would happen if you were to confront and accept this fear, rather than trying to avoid it through your need for control over the story's outcome? Would you be able to let go of the need for a satisfying ending and allow yourself to experience the uncertainty and surprise that reading can bring, or would you feel like you're too vulnerable or exposed?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think it's interesting that I've been able to identify this deeper fear of loss and disappointment, and I'm starting to realize that my need for a satisfying ending is actually a coping mechanism to deal with that fear.</div>
