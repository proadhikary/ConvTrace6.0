                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>ient: I don't really know where to start, but I've been feeling a lot of anxiety and self-doubt lately, especially when it comes to my hobby of building furniture.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>It's specifically when I can't find seasoned oak. I start to worry that anything I build will just look awful and it stops me from even starting a project.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like this issue with finding seasoned oak is really getting stuck in your head and affecting your ability to enjoy your hobby. Can you tell me more about what's so important to you about building furniture, and what you hope to achieve with your projects?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I guess it's just that I've always been proud of my work, and I feel like seasoned oak helps me create something truly special. Without it, I feel like I'm settling for something less.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like building furniture is not only a hobby, but also a way for you to express your creativity and pride in your work. The use of seasoned oak seems to be a key element in giving you a sense of accomplishment and satisfaction. Can you help me understand what you mean by something truly special and how you think seasoned oak contributes to that?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I mean, I guess I'm just trying to create something that's unique and has a certain... I don't know, a certain wow factor. Seasoned oak just feels like it's the perfect wood to get that look. Without it, I feel like my projects are just going to be average and nobody will care about them.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like the wow factor you're looking for is not just about the physical appearance of the wood, but also about the sense of pride and accomplishment you feel when you're able to create something truly unique and special. Can you tell me more about what you mean by nobody will care about them? What kind of reaction do you hope to get from others when they see your finished projects?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah, I guess it's just that I want people to appreciate the effort and craftsmanship that goes into my projects. I want them to be able to see the quality and attention to detail that I put into it.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're not just building furniture for the sake of building it, but you're also hoping to receive recognition and appreciation from others for your hard work and craftsmanship. The fear of not being able to achieve that with seasoned oak is really affecting your ability to enjoy your hobby. Can you help me understand what would happen if you were able to find a suitable alternative to seasoned oak? Would you still feel like you're settling for something less, or would you be able to find a way to be proud of your work regardless of the type of wood you use?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>That's a tough question. I guess if I had to use a different type of wood, I would still feel like I'm compromising on the quality of my work. I would feel like I'm just settling for something less, and that would be really frustrating for me.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like the idea of using a different type of wood is really difficult for you to accept, and it's hard for you to imagine being proud of your work without using seasoned oak. Can you help me understand what you think would happen if you were to focus more on the process of building, rather than the outcome? Would you be able to find joy in the creation and craftsmanship, regardless of the type of wood you use?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I'm not sure, it's hard for me to separate the process from the outcome. I feel like the outcome is what matters most, and if I'm not using seasoned oak, then it's not worth doing.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're really tied to the idea of achieving a specific outcome, and that's making it hard for you to enjoy the process of building. I want to gently challenge that idea by asking you to consider what would happen if you focused more on the process of building, rather than the outcome. What if you were to approach each project as an opportunity to learn, to experiment, and to create something unique, regardless of the type of wood you use? Would you be able to find joy in the journey, rather than just the destination?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I don't know, it's hard for me to imagine building something without having a clear idea of what it's going to look like in the end. I feel like that's what makes it worth doing for me.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're really used to having a clear vision of the final product before you start building, and that gives you a sense of direction and purpose. I get that. But what if, instead of having a clear idea of the outcome, you focused on the process of building itself? What if you approached each project as an opportunity to learn, to experiment, and to see where the wood takes you? Would you be able to find joy in the journey, even if you didn't know exactly what the final product would look like?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I understand what you're saying, but it's hard for me to let go of the idea of achieving a specific outcome. I've always been someone who likes to know what I'm getting myself into, and having a clear vision of the final product gives me a sense of control. But I can see how that might be limiting me and making it hard for me to enjoy the process of building. I'm willing to try to focus more on the process, but it's going to take some time for me to adjust to that mindset.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're willing to consider a new approach, but it's going to take some time and effort for you to adjust to it. Can you tell me what are some specific things you think you'll need to do to help you shift your focus from the outcome to the process? What are some small steps you can take to start building without having a clear idea of the final product?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think I need to start by setting aside my expectations and just allowing myself to be in the moment while I'm building. I need to focus on the sensation of the wood, the smell of the sawdust, and the sound of the tools. I need to let go of the need for perfection and just enjoy the process.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>That's a great start. It sounds like you're recognizing the importance of being present in the moment and letting go of your need for perfection. Can you help me understand what you mean by being in the moment when building? What specific things do you think you'll need to pay attention to in order to stay focused on the process, rather than the outcome?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I'm not sure what I mean by being in the moment when building, but I think it means focusing on the physical sensations and the sounds of the process, rather than worrying about the final product. I need to pay attention to the feel of the wood under my hands, the smell of the sawdust, and the sound of the tools. It's like meditation, but with a purpose.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're already starting to get a sense of what it means to be present in the moment while building. Focusing on the physical sensations and sounds of the process can be a powerful way to stay grounded and engaged. Can you help me understand what you mean by it's like meditation, but with a purpose? What do you think you'll accomplish by being more present in the moment while building, and how do you think it will help you shift your focus away from the outcome and towards the process?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think being in the moment while building will help me to focus on the process rather than the outcome, and it will allow me to appreciate the beauty of the wood and the craftsmanship that goes into each piece. It will also help me to let go of my need for perfection and to accept that it's okay to make mistakes and learn from them.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're already making a connection between being present in the moment and allowing yourself to appreciate the beauty of the wood and the craftsmanship.

What does that look like for you, and how do you think it will impact your approach to building?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>It's like I've been so focused on the end result that I've forgotten how to enjoy the process. By being present in the moment, I might actually start to appreciate the journey and the learning experience that comes with it. Maybe I'll start to see mistakes as opportunities to grow and improve, rather than as failures.</div>
