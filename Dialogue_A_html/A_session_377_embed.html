                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Hi Chase, I'm glad you could make it today. How are you feeling right now?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Client: It's just so frustrating. I put a lot of effort into that dinner, and her reaction to the dessert felt like a huge letdown. I can't seem to shake off this feeling of inadequacy.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Can you tell me more about what you mean by her reaction to the dessert felt like a huge letdown? What specifically did she say or do that made you feel that way?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I don't know, it just felt like she was being really critical, and her feedback was all negative. She said the dessert was bland and that I should have used more sugar. I felt like she was basically saying that my cooking skills are subpar.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Can you help me understand what's going on for you when you hear criticism about your cooking? Is it like your cooking is a reflection of your worth as a person, or is there something specific that triggers this feeling of inadequacy in you?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>It's like, what's the point of even trying if I'm just going to get criticized anyway? I mean, I know it's just a dessert, but it feels like she's questioning my entire ability to cook. And the worst part is, I feel like I'm going to make the same mistakes over and over again. It's like I'm stuck in this never-ending cycle of failure.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like the criticism about your cooking has triggered a sense of self-doubt and insecurity in you, and it's making you feel like you're not good enough. It's understandable that you feel that way, especially when it comes from someone close to you. Can you tell me more about what this feeling of being stuck in a cycle of failure reminds you of? Is there something specific in your past that comes up for you when you feel this way?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>It's hard for me to articulate, but it feels like I'm reliving my childhood again, where I was always trying to please my parents and never felt good enough. I was the kid who always got told what I was doing wrong, and I never felt like I was doing anything right. I guess it's just carried over into my adult life, and now I'm applying those same self-critical expectations to my cooking.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like the criticism about your cooking has awakened some old feelings of inadequacy and self-doubt that originated in your childhood. It's as if you're replaying those same experiences in your adult life, and it's causing you to feel stuck and unable to move forward. Can you tell me more about what you mean by trying to please your parents? What specific things did they say or do that made you feel like you weren't good enough?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah, it's like, my parents were always critical, and I was never good enough. They would always find fault in what I did, and I never felt like I could do anything right. They would say things like, Why can't you be more like your brother? or You're not living up to your potential. It was like, I was constantly trying to prove myself to them, but no matter what I did, it was never good enough. And now, with my girlfriend, it's like I'm reliving all those same feelings of inadequacy and self-doubt. It's like, I'm stuck in this never-ending cycle of trying to please others, and it's exhausting.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like your parents' constant criticism and unrealistic expectations had a profound impact on your sense of self-worth and confidence. It's no wonder that you're carrying those same feelings of inadequacy into your adult life and relationships. Can you help me understand what you think would happen if you were to stop trying to please others and start pleasing yourself? What would that look like, and what are your fears about taking that kind of approach?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>It's hard for me to imagine a situation where I'm not trying to please others, because that's just what I've always done. I'm scared that if I stop trying to please others, I'll be seen as selfish or lazy. And honestly, I don't know how to do anything else. I've spent so much time trying to prove myself to others that I've lost touch with what I want for myself.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you've been living your life trying to meet others' expectations, and you've lost sight of your own desires and needs. It's like you're driving a car with the parking brake on, and you're not even sure what direction you're going. You're scared to let go of this need to please others because you don't know what will happen if you do. But can you imagine what it would be like to take a deep breath, let go of this need to please others, and start exploring what you want for yourself? What do you think you would discover if you were to take this kind of approach?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I don't think I've ever really thought about what I want for myself. I've always been so focused on trying to please others that I haven't stopped to consider what makes me happy or fulfilled.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you've been carrying around a heavy burden of trying to meet others' expectations, and it's been exhausting. It's like you're carrying a big weight on your back, and you're not sure how to put it down. Can you imagine what it would be like to take a deep breath, let go of this need to please others, and start exploring what you want for yourself?

                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're carrying around a lot of fear and uncertainty about what would happen if you stopped trying to please others. It's like you're standing at the edge of a cliff, and you're not sure what's on the other side. Can you help me understand what specifically are you afraid of? Is it that others will reject you or that you'll lose their approval? Is it that you'll be seen as selfish or lazy? What are some of the specific fears that are driving this need to please others?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah, it's like, I'm scared that if I stop trying to please others, I'll be rejected or seen as selfish. I'm also afraid that I'll lose my sense of purpose and identity. I've always defined myself by what I can do for others, and I'm not sure who I am without that. I'm also worried that I'll be overwhelmed by the uncertainty of not knowing what others think of me. I've always relied on their validation to feel good about myself, and I'm not sure how to handle not having that validation.</div>

                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think I'm more scared of losing my sense of self and purpose than anything else. I've always defined myself by what I can do for others, and I'm not sure who I am without that. It's like, if I stop trying to please others, I'll be left with this huge void and I won't know how to fill it.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're deeply invested in this need to please others, and it's tied to your sense of identity and purpose.

                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think I'm finally starting to understand why I've been feeling so stuck and unhappy. It's like, I've been living my life through the validation of others, and I've lost touch with what makes me happy and fulfilled. I'm scared of stopping this cycle because I don't know how to fill the void that would be left behind, but at the same time, I feel like I'm suffocating under the weight of trying to please everyone else. I'm not sure what the future holds, but I do know that I need to start making changes if I want to be happy and fulfilled.</div>
