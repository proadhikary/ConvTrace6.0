                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Hello, William. Thank you for coming today. What brings you here?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>: Hi, thank you for seeing me. I've been feeling a bit down lately, especially since my daughter graduated from college. I guess it's made me think about my age and the things I might not be able to do anymore.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>I see. It sounds like this milestone has triggered some thoughts about your own mortality and the limitations that come with aging. Can you tell me more about what specifically is bothering you about this? Is it the thought of not being able to do certain things, or is it something else entirely?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah, it's definitely the thought of not being able to do certain things that's bothering me. I've always enjoyed physical activities like running and snowboarding, and the idea of not being able to do those things as easily or at all is really scary to me. It's like, what's the point of even trying if I'm just going to slow down and lose my ability to do the things I love?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like the thought of losing your physical abilities is really affecting you, and it's tied to your sense of identity and purpose. You've always defined yourself through these activities, and the idea of not being able to do them is making you feel like you're losing a part of yourself. Can you help me understand what you mean by 'what's the point of even trying' if you're not going to be able to do these things? What are you worried about leaving unfinished or not being able to accomplish?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah, I think what's really bothering me is this sense of uncertainty and lack of control. If I'm not going to be able to do the things I love, then what's the point of even trying? It's like, I don't know what my purpose is anymore. I've always defined myself through these physical activities, and now that's being taken away from me. It's like, I'm losing my identity.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're feeling a sense of loss and identity crisis, and it's really impacting your sense of purpose and direction. It's understandable that you're wondering what the point of even trying is if you're not going to be able to do the things that bring you joy and fulfillment. Can you help me understand what you mean by identity? Is it tied to your sense of self-worth, your relationships with others, or something else entirely?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think my identity is closely tied to my sense of self-worth. When I'm able to participate in physical activities, I feel like I'm still a young and capable person, and it gives me a sense of confidence and self-worth. But the thought of not being able to do those things is making me feel like I'm losing that sense of self-worth, like I'm becoming a different person, an older and less capable person. It's like, who am I if I'm not the person who can run marathons or go snowboarding?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like your sense of identity and self-worth are deeply tied to your physical abilities and the activities you enjoy. You've associated your youth and capability with your ability to participate in these activities, and the thought of losing that is making you feel like you're losing your sense of self-worth. It's as if you're worried that without these activities, you'll no longer be the person you know and love. Can you help me understand what you think would happen to your sense of self-worth if you were no longer able to do these things? Would it be like you're losing your sense of identity entirely, or would there be other aspects of yourself that could take its place?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>That's a tough question. I think if I couldn't do these things, it would be like I'm losing my sense of identity entirely. I'm not sure who I would be without them. I've always defined myself through these activities, and it's hard for me to imagine being someone else. But at the same time, I don't want to be stuck in the past, and I want to find new ways to stay active and engaged. I guess I'm just scared of losing that sense of confidence and self-worth that comes with being able to participate in these activities.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're worried that without these physical activities, you'll lose your sense of confidence and self-worth, and it's hard for you to imagine being someone else. It's understandable that you're scared of losing that part of yourself. Have you considered exploring what other activities or passions you might have that could bring you a sense of purpose and fulfillment? Are there any things you've always wanted to try but never had the time or energy for?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah, I've always wanted to try photography, but I never had the time or energy to pursue it. Now that my daughter is out of college, I have a bit more free time, and I've been thinking about picking up a camera and giving it a shot. It's funny, because when I think about photography, I don't feel like I'm going to lose my sense of identity or self-worth. It's like, I can still be a young and capable person even if I'm not running marathons or snowboarding.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're feeling a sense of hope and possibility when you think about photography, and that's really interesting. It's like, you're starting to envision a new identity for yourself that's not tied to your physical abilities. Can you tell me more about what draws you to photography? Is it the creative expression, the ability to capture moments, or something else entirely?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think what draws me to photography is the creative expression. I've always enjoyed taking pictures and capturing moments, and I've always been fascinated by the way a single image can evoke emotions and tell a story. When I think about photography, I don't feel like I'm losing my sense of identity or self-worth because it's not tied to my physical abilities. It's like, I can still be a young and capable person even if I'm not running marathons or snowboarding. And the thought of being able to capture moments and tell stories through my photography is really exciting to me. It's like, I'm not just limited to one activity or identity, I can explore and express myself in different ways.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like photography is offering you a sense of freedom and possibility, and that's really exciting. It's as if you're starting to envision a new identity for yourself that's not tied to your physical abilities. Can you help me understand what you mean by creative expression? Is it the process of taking the pictures, the end result of seeing the photos, or something else entirely? And how do you think photography might help you maintain a sense of purpose and fulfillment as you age?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah, I think the creative expression part is really important to me. When I'm taking pictures, I feel like I'm not just capturing moments, I'm creating something new and interesting. And the process of taking the pictures, trying different angles and lighting, it's like a puzzle to be solved, and that's really engaging for me. I think photography could help me maintain a sense of purpose and fulfillment as I age because it's not tied to my physical abilities, and it's something that I can do regardless of my age or physical condition. It's like, I can still be creative and express myself in different ways, even if I'm not as physically active as I used to be.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like your sense of identity and self-worth have been deeply tied to your physical abilities and the activities you enjoy, such as running and snowboarding. You've associated your youth and capability with your ability to participate in these activities, and the thought of losing that is making you feel like you're losing your sense of self-worth. It's as if you're worried that without these activities, you'll no longer be the person you know and love. But it seems like photography is offering you a sense of freedom and possibility, and it's not tied to your physical abilities. How do you think you might need to adapt your sense of identity and self-worth to make room for this new passion and interest in photography? Are there any specific fears or concerns you have about embracing this new aspect of yourself?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think I need to start separating my sense of identity and self-worth from my physical abilities. It's like, I've been so focused on who I am as a runner or a snowboarder that I haven't given myself permission to explore other aspects of myself. Photography is showing me that there's more to me than just my physical activities, and that's scary because it means I have to let go of this idea of who I am and what I'm capable of. But it's also exciting because it means I have the potential to discover new things about myself and find new ways to express myself. I think I need to start embracing this new aspect of myself and seeing what it has to offer.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're recognizing the need to adapt your sense of identity and self-worth to make room for this new passion and interest in photography. That can be a scary but also an exciting process. Can you help me understand what specifically is scary for you about embracing this new aspect of yourself? Is it the fear of losing your sense of identity as a runner or snowboarder, or is it the fear of not being good enough or not being able to master this new skill?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think what's scariest for me is the fear of losing my sense of identity as a runner or snowboarder. Those activities have been such a big part of my life for so long, and I'm not sure who I would be without them. It's like, I've defined myself so strongly around those activities that I'm not sure I know who I am without them. And the thought of not being able to do those things as easily or at all is really unsettling for me.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're feeling a strong sense of attachment to your identity as a runner and snowboarder, and the thought of losing that is really scary for you. It's as if you're worried that without those activities, you'll lose your sense of self and won't know who you are anymore. Can you help me understand what you think would happen to your sense of identity if you were no longer able to do these things? Would it be like you're losing your sense of identity entirely, or would there be other aspects of yourself that could take its place?</div>

I guess I need to keep working on separating my sense of identity and self-worth from my physical abilities. It's scary, but I think it's necessary for me to grow and discover new aspects of myself.</div>
