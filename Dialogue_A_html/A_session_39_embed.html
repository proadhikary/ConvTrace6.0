                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Hi Julia, thank you for coming in today. How are you feeling right now?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I just feel like I should have done more, you know? Maybe if I had noticed something was wrong earlier, my cat would still be here.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>I can imagine how devastating this must be for you, Julia. It sounds like you're beating yourself up over something that's not entirely in your control. Losing a pet is never easy, and it's understandable that you're replaying scenarios in your head wondering if there was anything you could have done differently. Can you tell me more about what's going through your mind when you think about what happened to your cat?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>That's just it, I don't know how I'm supposed to move on from this. I feel like I'm stuck in this endless loop of guilt and self-blame, and I don't know how to break free from it.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're not only struggling with the loss of your cat, but also with the feeling of being stuck in this emotional pain. I want you to know that it's okay to feel this way, and it's normal for grief to be a complex and messy process. Can you help me understand what 'moving on' means to you? What does that look like, and are there any specific things that you're worried about leaving behind or giving up if you were to start moving forward?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>It's like, I'm supposed to just get over it, you know? Finish grieving and move on with my life. But it's hard for me because I feel like I'm still stuck in this guilt and self-blame. I don't know how to let go of the feeling that I could have done something differently.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>I think what's really getting in the way for you is the sense that you're supposed to be able to control the uncontrollable. It's like you're holding onto this sense of responsibility, feeling like you should have been able to prevent your cat's passing. Can you help me understand what that control would look like for you? What would it mean to be able to 'let go' of this guilt and self-blame, and is it possible for you to imagine a life where you don't feel that weight?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>It's like, I'm trying to hold onto something that's slipping away from me. If I let go of the guilt and self-blame, I'm worried that it means I'm forgetting about my cat or that I'm not honoring their memory. It's like, I'm stuck between wanting to move on and wanting to hold onto the pain and guilt because it feels like it's the only thing that's left of my cat.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're caught between two conflicting desires - on one hand, you want to honor your cat's memory and hold onto the feelings of guilt and self-blame, and on the other hand, you want to move on with your life. It's as if you're holding onto the pain as a way of keeping your cat's memory alive. Can you help me understand what you mean by 'honoring their memory'? What does that look like for you, and is it possible to find ways to do that that don't involve holding onto the guilt and self-blame?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I guess what I mean by honoring their memory is that I feel like if I let go of the guilt and self-blame, I'm somehow erasing my cat's existence. I don't know how to balance the need to move on with the need to hold onto the memories and the pain. It feels like a never-ending struggle.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're carrying a heavy burden of responsibility for your cat's passing, and the fear of 'erasing' their memory is a significant concern for you. I want to reassure you that it's possible to honor your cat's memory in ways that don't involve holding onto guilt and self-blame. Perhaps we can explore some ways to do that together. In the meantime, I want to gently challenge the idea that letting go of guilt and self-blame means erasing your cat's existence. Can you imagine a scenario where you're able to hold onto the happy memories you shared with your cat, while also acknowledging that their passing was a natural part of life, and that you did the best you could as a pet owner?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I'm trying to understand what you mean by honoring their memory without holding onto guilt and self-blame.

                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're really struggling to reconcile your desire to move on with your need to hold onto your cat's memory. I want to acknowledge that it's a difficult and complex process, and it's okay that you're taking your time to figure it out. Can we explore the idea of creating a memorial or ritual that would allow you to honor your cat's memory in a way that feels meaningful to you, but doesn't involve holding onto guilt and self-blame? Maybe we can brainstorm some ideas together, or you can take some time to think about what that might look like for you. Would that be something that resonates with you?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I'm not sure. I feel like I'm just supposed to move on and forget about my cat, but it's hard for me to do that when I feel like I'm still stuck in this guilt and self-blame. I don't know how to balance my desire to move on with my need to hold onto the memories and the pain. It feels like a never-ending struggle.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're feeling a lot of pressure to move on and forget about your cat, but it's understandable that you're struggling with that. It's as if you're being pulled in two different directions - the desire to hold onto the memories and the pain, and the need to move on with your life. Can we take a step back and explore what it would mean for you to truly 'move on'? What would that look like, and what would you be leaving behind? Maybe we can find a way to redefine what moving on means for you, one that doesn't involve erasing your cat's memory or abandoning your feelings of grief.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I understand what you're saying, but it's hard for me to imagine a life where I don't feel like I'm responsible for my cat's passing. It's like, I'm stuck between wanting to move on and wanting to hold onto the pain and guilt because it feels like it's the only thing that's left of my cat. I don't know how to balance my desire to move on with my need to hold onto the memories and the pain. It feels like a never-ending struggle.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>I think I understand that you're feeling stuck in this impossible choice between holding onto the guilt and self-blame, and moving on with your life. But I want to gently suggest that maybe we're not looking at this as a binary choice. Maybe there's a way to acknowledge your cat's passing, and the role you played in their life, without getting stuck in the guilt and self-blame. Can you imagine a life where you're able to honor your cat's memory, and acknowledge your own feelings of grief and loss, without letting it consume you? Maybe we can find a way to create a sense of closure and acceptance that allows you to move forward, while still holding onto the memories and love you shared with your cat.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>It's like, I've been so focused on the guilt and self-blame that I haven't really thought about what it would mean to truly move on. I guess what I'm afraid of is that if I let go of the guilt, I'll be forgetting about my cat and what we shared. But at the same time, I feel like I'm stuck in this never-ending struggle, and I don't know how to break free from it.</div>

                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think I'm starting to understand what you mean by honoring their memory without holding onto guilt and self-blame. It's hard for me to imagine a life where I don't feel like I'm responsible for my cat's passing, but maybe there's a way to acknowledge my cat's existence without getting stuck in the guilt and self-blame. I'm willing to explore this idea further and see if we can find a way to create a sense of closure and acceptance that allows me to move forward while still holding onto the memories and love I shared with my cat.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're really opening up to the possibility of a different way of honoring your cat's memory. I'm proud of you for being willing to explore this idea further. Can we start by brainstorming some ideas for a memorial or ritual that would allow you to honor your cat's memory in a way that feels meaningful to you, but doesn't involve holding onto guilt and self-blame? Maybe we can think about something that celebrates your cat's life, rather than their passing. What do you think?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think that's a great idea. A memorial or ritual that celebrates my cat's life could be a way to honor their memory without getting stuck in the guilt and self-blame. I'm not sure what that would look like, but I'm willing to explore some ideas. Maybe we could do something like plant a tree or a flower in their memory, or create a memory book with pictures and stories about our time together. I'm not sure, but I'm open to suggestions.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're really leaning into the idea of creating a memorial or ritual that would allow you to honor your cat's memory in a way that feels meaningful to you. I love that idea! A memorial or ritual that celebrates your cat's life could be a beautiful way to acknowledge their existence without getting stuck in the guilt and self-blame. Let's brainstorm some ideas together. What do you think about doing something like planting a tree or a flower in their memory? Or maybe creating a memory book with pictures and stories about your time together? Are there any other ideas that come to mind for you?</div>
