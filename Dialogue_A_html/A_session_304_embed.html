                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Hello, Leonard. It's nice to meet you. How have you been feeling lately?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I've been feeling kind of down recently. I often feel like I'm a bad grandson, especially when my grandpa doesn't act how I expect him to.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Can you tell me more about what you mean by 'not acting how you expect him to'? What are some specific things that bother you about his behavior?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah, like when he doesn't take me to get ice cream like he usually does. It makes me feel like I've done something wrong or that he's disappointed in me. I start thinking that maybe I'm not a good grandson after all, and it really bothers me.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like these small changes in your grandpa's behavior have a big impact on you and make you feel like you're not meeting his expectations. Can you help me understand what's going on when this happens? Do you think your grandpa is aware of how his actions affect you, and have you talked to him about how you feel?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah, I think he's not really aware of it, and even if he was, I'm not sure he'd understand. He's a proud man and might not want to admit that his feelings are hurt or that he's disappointed in me. I've tried talking to my grandma about it, but she just tells me to be patient and that grandpa loves me no matter what. It's hard for me to believe that when I feel like I've let him down.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're feeling a lot of responsibility to make your grandpa happy and that his behavior is really affecting your self-perception. It can be tough to feel like you're not meeting someone's expectations, especially when it's someone you care about. Have you noticed any patterns or triggers that make your grandpa behave in ways that make you feel like you're not a good grandson?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah, I think I have noticed a pattern. It usually happens when I make a mistake or don't do something exactly the way he wants me to. I start to feel like I'm not good enough, and that feeling just grows and grows until I'm convinced that I'm the worst grandson ever.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're experiencing a lot of self-doubt and negative self-talk when your grandpa doesn't meet your expectations. It's like you're beating yourself up over small mistakes. Can you help me understand what's driving this self-criticism? Is it something you've learned from your grandpa or is it more of an internalized message?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah, I think it's a mix of both. Sometimes I feel like I'm internalizing his disappointment and making it my own, and other times I feel like I'm just naturally self-critical. I don't know if it's because of some past experiences or if it's just my personality, but it's definitely a pattern that I've noticed.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're carrying around a lot of self-doubt and self-criticism, and it's affecting your sense of self-worth. It's understandable that you would internalize your grandpa's disappointment, especially if you feel like you're close to him. But it's also important to recognize that his behavior is not a reflection of your worth as a person. Can you help me understand what you think would happen if you were to let go of this self-criticism and try to focus on your own strengths and worthiness, rather than trying to meet your grandpa's expectations?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah, I think that would be really hard for me to do. I've always felt like I have to make my grandpa happy, and it's hard for me to see that his behavior isn't a reflection of my worth. But maybe if I could start to focus on my own strengths and what makes me feel good about myself, I could start to let go of this self-criticism.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're carrying around a lot of responsibility to make your grandpa happy, and that's affecting your sense of self-worth. I want to gently challenge that idea - it's not your job to make your grandpa happy, and his behavior is not a reflection of your worth as a person. You are more than just his grandson, and you have your own strengths, worthiness, and value. Would you be willing to explore some ways to cultivate self-compassion and self-acceptance, and let go of the need to meet your grandpa's expectations?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I can see how that would be really helpful, but it's hard for me to let go of the feeling that I'm responsible for my grandpa's happiness. It's like, I know intellectually that I'm not responsible, but emotionally it feels like I am. And what if he's really upset about something, and I'm not there to fix it? What if I'm not good enough to make him happy?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're carrying around a lot of emotional responsibility for your grandpa's happiness, and that's making it hard for you to let go of this sense of responsibility to make him happy. I understand that it's scary to think about not being able to fix things or make him happy, but here's the thing: you can't control how others feel, and you can't fix everything that goes wrong in their lives. What you can control is how you respond to those feelings and how you treat yourself. Would you be willing to explore some ways to cultivate self-compassion and self-acceptance, even when things don't go exactly as you want them to?</div>

Can we explore some ways for me to cultivate self-compassion and self-acceptance, even when things don't go exactly as I want them to?</div>

                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think being his rock and support system means that I'm always supposed to be there for him, to listen to his problems and offer advice or solutions. It's like I'm supposed to be his safety net, and if I'm not there for him, then he's going to feel abandoned or disappointed.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're carrying a heavy burden of responsibility to be there for your grandpa, and that's affecting your relationship with him.

Is it because you feel like you're not getting something from him, or is it because you genuinely want to be there for him? And what do you think would happen if you started to let go of that responsibility and focused more on your own needs and well-being?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think I've been carrying this burden of responsibility because I feel like I need his approval and love to feel worthy and loved myself. I've always felt like I'm not good enough, and that's why I'm constantly trying to prove myself to him. But now that I'm thinking about it, I realize that's not true. I am worthy and loved, regardless of what he thinks.</div>
