                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Hello Michael, it's nice to meet you. How are you feeling today?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I've been feeling pretty down since my trip to Frankfurt. It was just so stressful with the cramped plane rides, overpriced food, and no wifi. It's like all I can remember are the negatives, and it's really getting to me.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Michael, it sounds like the trip to Frankfurt was a real source of stress for you. It's understandable that you're feeling down after that experience. Can you tell me more about what specifically was most upsetting for you during the trip? Was it the physical discomfort, the lack of amenities, or something else entirely?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Honestly, everything was just so overwhelming. The cramped plane rides were a nightmare, and the food was ridiculous. But I think what really got to me was the lack of wifi. I needed to stay connected for work, and not being able to do that was frustrating and stressful. I just felt like I was stuck in this tiny space with no way to relax or be productive.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like the lack of wifi was a significant source of stress for you, and it's understandable that not being able to stay connected and productive would be frustrating. It's almost as if the lack of wifi was a symbol of feeling disconnected and out of control. Can you tell me more about what you were trying to accomplish while you were on the trip, and how not being able to do so affected you?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah, I was really counting on being able to stay connected and get some work done during the trip. Not being able to do that made me feel like I was failing or that I wasn't capable of managing my responsibilities. It's like, even though I was on vacation, I was still expected to be available and productive, and that added to the stress.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like the lack of wifi was not only frustrating, but also a source of self-doubt and feelings of inadequacy. It's as if you felt like you were being pulled in two different directions - you wanted to relax and enjoy your vacation, but you also felt like you needed to be available and productive. Can you tell me more about what you think others might be expecting of you, and how that added to your stress and feelings of overwhelm?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah, I think others were expecting me to be able to handle the trip and stay connected easily. My boss was expecting me to be available, and my colleagues were probably expecting me to be checking in and responding to emails. And on top of that, I was putting pressure on myself to make the most of the trip and not let the stress get to me. It's like, I was trying to live up to everyone's expectations, including my own, and that just added to the overwhelm.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you were shouldering a lot of responsibility and pressure, not just from your boss and colleagues, but also from yourself. It's no wonder you felt overwhelmed and stressed. Can you tell me more about what you think you would need to feel like you're meeting everyone's expectations and being able to relax and enjoy your vacation? Is there something specific you would need to do or accomplish to feel like you're doing okay?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah, I think I would need to be able to stay connected and get some work done, but also make time for myself and do things that I enjoy. Like, I wish I could've just taken a break from work and focused on relaxing and exploring the city. But I felt like I was stuck in this cycle of trying to be productive and available all the time.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're really struggling with the idea of taking a break and truly disconnecting from work. It's like you're caught between two opposing desires - wanting to relax and enjoy your vacation, but also feeling like you need to be available and productive. Can we explore this idea of what it means to truly disconnect and take a break? What would that look like for you, and how do you think you might need to make changes to your expectations and priorities in order to make that happen?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah, I think I would need to reevaluate my priorities and expectations about what I need to do during a trip. I need to realize that it's okay to take a break and not be constantly connected and productive. I also need to communicate better with my boss and colleagues about what I can and can't do during a trip, and set clear boundaries for myself.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're feeling a lot of pressure to be available and productive even when you're on vacation, and that's causing a lot of stress and overwhelm. It's interesting that you mention wanting to reevaluate your priorities and expectations about what you need to do during a trip. Can you tell me more about what you think would happen if you were to let go of the need to be constantly connected and productive? Would you feel like you're missing out on something important, or would you feel like you're finally able to relax and enjoy your vacation?</div>
