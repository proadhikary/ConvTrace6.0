                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Hi Gregory, it's nice to meet you. How are you feeling today?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>It's been really tough. I feel like my wife doesn't even like me anymore, and losing my job just made everything worse.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>I'm so sorry to hear that, Gregory. It sounds like you're really struggling with feelings of rejection and loss right now. Can you tell me more about what's been going on with your wife and how you've been experiencing that feeling of not being liked? What does that look like for you?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I don't know, it's like... she just doesn't seem to care about me anymore. She used to hold my hand, give me little touches, and just be all affectionate. Now, it's like she's just tolerating me. And it's not just that, it's like she's always busy, always working, and never has time for me. It's like I'm just an afterthought.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Can you help me understand what you think might have caused this shift in your wife's behavior? Is there anything that you've done differently or any changes that have happened in your relationship that might be contributing to this feeling of being invisible to her?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Ugh, I don't know... I feel like I've just been trying to make ends meet and support us financially, and maybe she feels like I'm not doing enough or that I'm not good enough for her. But honestly, I don't know what else I could do. I've been trying to talk to her about it, but like I said, it always ends in arguments and misunderstandings.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're feeling really stuck and helpless in this situation, Gregory. It's like you're trying to do your part, but somehow it's not seeming to be enough for your wife. Can you help me understand what you think you're trying to prove to her by working so hard and providing financially? Is there a part of you that's thinking that if you can just do enough, she'll come back to you and appreciate you again?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I guess so... I mean, I thought that if I could just provide for us, she would see how hard I'm working and appreciate me more. But it's like, even when I'm doing everything right, it's never good enough. And now I'm starting to feel like I'm just a burden to her, like she's only staying with me because of our obligations, not because she actually wants to be with me.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're feeling a deep sense of loneliness and disconnection from your wife, Gregory. It's like you're trying to prove your worth to her through your work and financial provision, but no matter how hard you try, it's not seeming to be enough. Can you help me understand what you think would happen if you stopped trying to prove yourself to her? If you let go of the need for her approval and appreciation, what do you think would be different for you in this relationship?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah, it's like, what's the point of even trying if nothing's going to change? I feel like I'm just going through the motions, and it's all just a waste of time. I don't know if I even want to be in this relationship anymore.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Gregory, it sounds like you're feeling a great deal of emotional pain and confusion. It's like you're trapped in this cycle of trying to prove yourself to your wife, and no matter how hard you try, it's not seeming to work. It's no wonder you're feeling lonely and disconnected from her. I want to acknowledge that it takes a lot of courage to admit that you're feeling this way. It sounds like you're at a crossroads in your relationship, and you're wondering if it's even worth continuing. Can you help me understand what you think you would need to feel like you're not just going through the motions in this relationship? What would need to change for you to feel like you're truly connected to your wife again?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I don't know what I need, it just feels like I've been stuck in this rut for so long and I'm not sure how to get out of it. I feel like I've tried talking to my wife, I've tried working harder, but nothing seems to be working. I'm just feeling so lost and alone right now.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're feeling really hopeless and stuck, Gregory. It's like you've been trying to solve this problem on your own, and it's just not working. It's no wonder you're feeling lost and alone. Can you help me understand what you think would happen if you were to accept that you can't control your wife's behavior or approval? What if you just allowed yourself to feel whatever emotions come up for you, without trying to change your wife or prove yourself to her?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I don't know, it just feels like I've been trying to prove myself to my wife for so long, and it's like I've lost myself in the process. I feel like I'm just going through the motions, trying to be the perfect husband, but it's not working. I'm not even sure what I want anymore.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're feeling exhausted and depleted from trying to prove yourself to your wife. It's like you've been running on a treadmill and getting nowhere. Can you help me understand what you think you would need to feel like you're taking care of yourself in this relationship? What would need to change for you to feel like you're not sacrificing your own well-being for the sake of your marriage?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>It's just really hard for me to accept that I can't control my wife's behavior or approval. I feel like I've been trying to fix everything and make her love me again, but it's like I'm just spinning my wheels. I don't know how to let go of the need to be perfect and just be myself.</div>
