                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Hello, Russell. Iâ€™m glad you could make it today. How are you feeling right now?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I just feel like no matter what I do, I'm never going to get out of this rut. It's like I'm stuck in this never-ending cycle of dead-end jobs.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Russell, it sounds like you're feeling really frustrated and stuck right now. Can you tell me more about what you mean by dead-end jobs? Is it the work itself that's the problem, or is it something else that's going on in your life that's making you feel like you're not making progress?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I don't know, maybe it's just me being pessimistic, but every job I've ever had has felt like it's just a means to an end. I've never really felt like I'm doing something meaningful or fulfilling. And every time I try to apply for a better job, it feels like a waste of time because I just get rejected or ignored. It's like I'm just not good enough or capable enough to get ahead.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're not only feeling stuck in your jobs, but also in your sense of purpose and self-worth. It's like you're not living up to your own expectations, and that's causing a lot of pain and frustration. Can you tell me more about what you mean by meaningful or fulfilling work? What are some things that you've always been passionate about or enjoyed doing, but may not have been able to pursue in your jobs?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I don't know, it's hard for me to think about what I've always been passionate about because I've never really had the opportunity to explore my interests. I've always just been focused on making a living and supporting myself. And even when I do get a chance to do something I enjoy, it's usually just a temporary thing and I have to go back to the same old routine. It feels like I'm just going through the motions, you know?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you've never really had the chance to explore your passions and interests, and that's leaving you feeling unfulfilled and restless. It's like you're just going through the motions of life without any real sense of purpose or direction. Can you tell me how that makes you feel? Is there a particular moment or experience that stands out to you as particularly painful or disappointing, or is it more of a general feeling that's been building up over time?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah, it's just this constant feeling of emptiness and dissatisfaction. It's like I'm just going through the motions of life without any real sense of purpose or direction. I guess what's really painful is thinking about all the things I could have done differently if I had the chance. It's like I've been stuck in this rut for so long, and I don't know how to get out of it.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're carrying around a lot of regret and what if's, wondering what could have been if you had made different choices. It's like you're replaying a movie in your head, reliving all the moments that led you to where you are now. Can you tell me more about what you mean by things I could have done differently? Are there specific decisions or events that you feel were turning points, or is it more of a general feeling of not living up to your own expectations?</div>

                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're carrying around a lot of weight from past decisions and choices, and that's making it hard for you to move forward. Can you help me understand what you mean by things I could have done differently?

                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>It's just that, no matter what I do, it feels like I'm not good enough or capable enough to get ahead. It's like I'm stuck in this cycle of self-doubt and negativity, and I don't know how to break free from it.</div>
