                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Hi Riley, welcome. I'm glad you're here today. How are you feeling about this session?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>It's just hard to see how talking about it will help. I mean, Iâ€™ve already tried researching and talking to career coaches, and nothing's changed.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>I completely understand your skepticism, Riley. It's understandable that you've already put in effort and haven't seen the results you were hoping for. Can you tell me a bit more about what's been going on for you in your career that's feeling stuck? What are some specific things that are causing you distress or frustration?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I don't know, it just feels like I'm stuck in this rut and I can't find a way out. Every time I watch documentaries or read about exploration adventures, I feel even more frustrated because it just reminds me of what I'm missing out on. And it's not just about the job, it's about feeling like I'm not living up to my potential.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're feeling a sense of disappointment and unfulfillment in your career, and that it's affecting your sense of purpose and identity. It's like you're feeling stuck and unable to move forward, and that's really tough. Can you help me understand what you mean by living up to your potential? What does that look like to you, and how do you think your current career is impacting that?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I guess I just feel like I'm not doing what I'm meant to do, you know? Like, I'm only 20 and I'm already feeling like I've wasted so much time just going through the motions. It's like I'm stuck in this predetermined path and I don't have the courage to take a different route.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're carrying a lot of pressure to live up to your own expectations, and that's causing you a lot of distress. It's like you're comparing your current situation to some idealized version of yourself and feeling like you're falling short. Can you help me understand what you mean by going through the motions? What specifically feels like you're not doing in your current career that you wish you were doing?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah, it's like I'm just going through the motions, you know? I'm doing my job, but it doesn't feel like I'm really making a difference or doing something that truly matters. And it's not just the job itself, it's the fact that I'm not even close to the kind of adventures I've always dreamed of having. It's like I'm stuck in this comfortable but unfulfilling routine, and I don't know how to break free from it.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like a sense of purpose and meaning are really missing for you, and that's causing a lot of discomfort. It's like you're feeling stuck in a rut and unable to move forward. Can we explore this idea of comfortable but unfulfilling routine a bit more? What specifically feels uncomfortable about it, and what are some things that you think would need to change in order for you to feel more fulfilled and purposeful?</div>

                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like watching documentaries and reading about exploration adventures triggers a sense of longing and frustration for you, and that's really understandable. It's like you're being reminded of what could be, but isn't currently, and that can be really painful. Can we explore what you think would need to happen for you to feel like you're living up to your potential and not feeling stuck in this rut? Is there something specific that you think would need to change in your career or life in general for you to feel more fulfilled and purposeful?</div>

                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I feel like I've been trying to avoid talking about this because it's just too painful to admit that I'm not living up to my own expectations. I guess I'm scared that if I really dig into it, I'll realize that I'll never be able to fulfill my dreams of exploration and adventure.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're carrying a lot of fear around not meeting your own expectations, and that's causing you a lot of distress. It's like you're afraid to even look at what's not working in your life because it might mean giving up on your dreams entirely. Can we explore this fear together? What do you think would happen if you did dig into it and realize that your dreams of exploration and adventure might not come true? How would you handle that?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>It's hard to admit, but I think I've been using my fear of not meeting my expectations as a way to avoid taking action towards my dreams.
