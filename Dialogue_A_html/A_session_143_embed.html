                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Hello Hunter, welcome. How are you feeling today?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>It's just that I can't stop thinking about him. Every time I see a happy couple or something romantic, it brings back all those memories, and it feels like I'm stuck in the past.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Can you tell me more about this person, him? What was your relationship like, and what happened that's causing you to think about him so much?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah, I guess it's just that our relationship was really great, and I feel like I've lost that sense of connection and happiness with someone else. When we were together, he made me feel seen and heard in a way that no one else has since.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're really missing the sense of connection and happiness you felt with him. Can you tell me more about what specifically made you feel seen and heard by him? Was it something he would say or do, or was it more of an overall feeling you got from being around him?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah, it was a combination of things. He was always really supportive and encouraging, and he would listen to me when I needed someone to talk to. He also had a way of making me feel like I was the only person in the room, like he was fully present and engaged with me.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like he had a very profound impact on your sense of self and your emotional well-being. The fact that you felt seen and heard by him is a really important aspect of any relationship, and it's no wonder that you're missing that sense of connection. Can you tell me more about what happened in the relationship that led to its end? What was the nature of his departure, and how did you feel about it at the time?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah, it was a really tough breakup, and I still haven't fully processed my emotions about it. He just kind of stopped showing up, and I was left wondering what had happened and why he didn't want to be with me anymore. I felt so lost and alone, and it was like my whole world was crumbling around me.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like the end of your relationship was very abrupt and unexpected, and it's no wonder that you're still processing your emotions about it. It can be really painful to feel like someone just suddenly disappeared from your life without explanation. Can you tell me more about what you're experiencing now in terms of emotions? Are there any specific feelings or thoughts that keep coming up for you when you think about him or the relationship?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah, it's like this constant ache in my chest, and I can't seem to shake it off. Sometimes it feels like I'm stuck in this perpetual state of longing and nostalgia, and it's hard to imagine moving on from that.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're carrying a lot of emotional pain from the breakup, and it's understandable that you'd want to hold onto the good memories of your relationship with him. It's also clear that the way he ended things left you with a lot of unanswered questions and a deep sense of loss. Can you tell me more about this ache in your chest? Is it a physical sensation, or is it more of a emotional feeling? And do you think that's related to the longing and nostalgia you mentioned?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>It's hard for me to explain, but it's like my heart is still heavy with the weight of our relationship. It's not just a feeling, it's almost like a physical sensation, like there's a knot in my chest that I can't untie. And yeah, I think it's definitely related to the longing and nostalgia I feel when I think about him. It's like my brain is trying to hold onto the good memories, but it's also making it hard for me to move on.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like the ache in your chest is a tangible, physical sensation that's closely tied to the emotional pain and longing you're experiencing. It's as if your heart is still carrying the weight of your relationship with him, and it's hard to let go of that. Can you explore with me what you think would need to happen in order for you to start to untie this knot in your chest and begin to move on from this relationship?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think I would need to find a way to confront the uncertainty and lack of closure surrounding the end of our relationship. I need to stop wondering what happened and why he left me, and instead focus on healing and moving forward.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're still grappling with a lot of unresolved emotions and unanswered questions from the end of your relationship. It's understandable that you'd want to find some sense of closure and clarity about what happened. Can you tell me more about what you mean by confronting the uncertainty and lack of closure? What specific steps do you think you might need to take in order to start to untie this knot in your chest and move on from this relationship?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think it would involve writing a letter to him or having a conversation with him, just to get some sense of closure and understanding about why he ended things. It might also involve talking to friends or family members who were close to us during the relationship and asking them if they noticed anything unusual or if they have any insight into what happened. I'm not sure, but I just feel like I need to confront this uncertainty head-on and get some kind of resolution before I can start moving on.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like the unresolved questions and lack of closure around the end of your relationship with him are still causing you a lot of emotional pain and distress.

                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think it's hard for me to confront the uncertainty and lack of closure surrounding the end of our relationship because it feels like I'm still waiting for him to come back and explain himself, even though I know that's not possible. It's like my brain is stuck on this idea that he's going to come back and apologize and make everything okay again, and that's just not going to happen.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're struggling to accept that the relationship is truly over and that he's not going to come back to explain himself or make things right again.

Can you explore with me why you think it's so hard for you to let go of the idea that he might come back?

                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think what's hard for me to let go of is the sense of security and comfort I felt when we were together. He made me feel seen and heard in a way that no one else has since, and I miss that. I miss the feeling of being in a relationship where I felt like I was the only person in the room.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like the sense of security and comfort you felt in your relationship with him is still very present for you, and that's making it hard for you to let go of the idea that he might come back and make things right again.

                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think what's been really challenging for me is that I've been stuck in this place of nostalgia and longing, and I feel like I'm just going through the motions of my daily life without really being present in it. I'm constantly thinking about him and wondering what could have been, and it's like I'm stuck in this perpetual state of what if.</div>
