                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Hi Maven, I'm glad you are here today. How are you feeling as we start this session?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I'm feeling a bit nervous, honestly. Not really sure what to expect.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Maven, it's completely normal to feel nervous when starting a new therapy session. Can you tell me a bit more about what's making you feel nervous? Is it the idea of talking about your feelings with a stranger, or is there something specific that's on your mind that's causing you anxiety?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Well, I think it's a mix of both. I'm just not sure what to expect from this process, and I'm worried that you might think I'm silly for feeling this way about my sister playing the guitar.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>That's completely understandable, Maven. It takes a lot of courage to share your concerns with someone new. I want to assure you that everything we discuss in this session is confidential and a safe space for you to express yourself. Can you tell me more about your concerns regarding your sister playing the guitar? What specifically is bothering you about it?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah, it's just that I feel like my sister looks down on me because I can't play an instrument, and it makes me feel like I'm not good enough or talented enough. It's like I'm constantly comparing myself to her, and it's really affecting my self-esteem.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Maven, it sounds like your sister's ability to play the guitar has become a source of comparison and self-doubt for you. Can you help me understand more about what you mean by looking down on you? Is it her words, actions, or something else that's making you feel this way? And how has this been affecting your daily life?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah, it's hard to explain, but sometimes I feel like she's judging me or not taking me seriously because I don't play an instrument. It's like, I'll be talking to her about something, and then she'll bring up her guitar practice or a concert she's going to, and it feels like she's trying to one-up me or show off. It makes me feel like I'm not good enough or interesting enough, like I'm just not measuring up to her standards.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Maven, it sounds like your sister's behavior and comments have created a sense of inferiority and self-doubt within you, making you feel like you're not good enough or talented enough. It's as if you're constantly trying to measure up to her standards, and when you feel like you're falling short, it affects your self-esteem and daily life. Can you tell me more about how this comparison makes you feel? Is it like you're constantly striving to be better, or does it lead to feelings of frustration, anger, or sadness?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah, it's a mix of all those emotions. Sometimes I feel like I'm constantly trying to prove myself, like I'm in a competition with my sister, and it's exhausting. I feel like I'm never good enough, and it's like this constant nagging feeling in the back of my mind that I'm not living up to my potential.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Maven, it sounds like this constant comparison to your sister's abilities is taking a significant toll on your self-esteem and daily life. It's understandable that you might feel like you're in a competition with her, especially if you feel like she's constantly trying to one-up you. Can you tell me more about what you think you would need to feel like you're measuring up to her standards? What would that look like for you, and what do you think would bring you a sense of validation and self-worth?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah, I think it would be great if I could play the guitar as well as my sister or at least be decent at it. I think if I could do that, I would feel more confident and more worthy in her eyes. But the thing is, even if I do learn to play the guitar, I'm not sure it would really make a difference because I would still be comparing myself to her and feeling like I'm not good enough. And that's what's so frustrating - no matter what I do, I always feel like I'm coming up short.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Maven, it sounds like you're caught in a cycle of self-doubt and comparison, where no matter what you do, you feel like you're not good enough or talented enough in comparison to your sister. You've mentioned that even if you were to learn to play the guitar, you're not sure it would bring you the sense of validation and self-worth you're looking for. That's a really important insight, and I want to acknowledge the complexity of this issue. It's not just about learning to play an instrument, but about the underlying feelings of inadequacy and like you're not measuring up to your sister's standards. Can you help me understand what you think is driving this need to measure up to her standards? Is it a desire to be close to her, or is it more about proving yourself to others?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah, I think it's a mix of both. I want to be close to my sister and have a good relationship with her, but at the same time, I feel like I'm constantly trying to prove myself to her and to others. I think it's also because I feel like I'm not living up to my own potential, and I'm trying to push myself to be better, to be more talented, to be more accomplished.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Maven, it sounds like you're struggling with a deep-seated desire to prove yourself to your sister and to others, which is rooted in a fear of not living up to your own potential. It's as if you're constantly trying to measure up to an unattainable standard, and it's exhausting and demoralizing. Can you help me understand what you think would happen if you were to let go of this need to prove yourself? What would that look like for you, and what do you think would bring you a sense of peace and self-acceptance?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think if I were to let go of this need to prove myself, I would feel a sense of relief and freedom. I wouldn't be constantly comparing myself to my sister or feeling like I'm not good enough. I would be able to focus on my own interests and passions without feeling like I'm not measuring up.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Maven, it sounds like you're carrying a significant burden of self-doubt and comparison, which is affecting your daily life and relationships. It's remarkable that you're acknowledging the complexity of this issue and the underlying drivers of your desire to prove yourself. I want to acknowledge your courage in sharing this with me. As we continue to explore this further, I'd like to propose an exercise to help you gain a deeper understanding of your values and passions. I'd like you to take some time to reflect on what brings you joy and fulfillment outside of your comparisons with your sister. What are the things you enjoy doing, the activities that make you feel alive and engaged? Let's explore those together in our next session.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>That sounds like a great idea, I think I can really benefit from focusing on my own interests and passions rather than constantly comparing myself to my sister. I'm looking forward to exploring this further in our next session.</div>

                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think I'm starting to understand why I've been carrying this burden of self-doubt and comparison. It's not just about playing the guitar or being talented, it's about feeling like I'm not good enough or worthy in my sister's eyes. And I realize now that this feeling of inadequacy is not a reflection of her, but rather a reflection of my own deep-seated fears and insecurities.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Maven, it sounds like we've made some significant progress in understanding the underlying drivers of your desire to prove yourself. I want to acknowledge your courage in sharing this with me and your willingness to explore these complex emotions. It's clear that this issue is deeply rooted in your relationship with your sister and your desire to be close to her. But I want to gently challenge you to consider that your self-worth and sense of validation are not tied to your sister's opinion or approval. You are more than your ability to play the guitar or your sister's standards. What would happen if you were to let go of this need to prove yourself and focus on your own values and passions? What would bring you a sense of peace and self-acceptance?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think I'm starting to see that my self-worth is not defined by my sister's opinion or approval. It's scary to let go of this need to prove myself, but I feel like I'm carrying around this heavy burden of self-doubt and comparison, and it's exhausting. I want to focus on my own values and passions and find joy and fulfillment in those things, rather than constantly trying to measure up to my sister's standards.</div>
