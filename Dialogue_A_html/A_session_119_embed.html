                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Hello Carlos, I'm glad you could make it today. What brings you here to see me?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I've been really struggling with cooking. I feel like I should be good at it because my dad was a cook, but I just can't seem to get it right.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like cooking holds a lot of significance for you, especially given your dad's background. Can you tell me more about what's specifically going on that's making you feel like you're not good at it? Is it the dishes not turning out right, or is it something else entirely?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah, it's a combination of things. I feel like my dishes never turn out as good as my dad's, and when I cook for my spouse, I feel like I'm not meeting their expectations. It's like I'm constantly comparing myself to my dad and coming up short.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like there's a lot of pressure you're putting on yourself to live up to your dad's standards, and also to meet your spouse's expectations. And it's not just about the cooking, but about feeling like you're not good enough. Can you imagine what your dad would say to you if you told him how you're feeling?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah, it's hard to think about what he would say because I'm not sure I want to know. I'm scared that he would tell me that I'm not good enough, that I'm a disappointment.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're worried about your dad's judgment and criticism, and that's creating a lot of anxiety for you. Can you explore with me what it would mean to you if your dad did say those things? Would it be a blow to your self-esteem, or would it be a wake-up call for you to re-evaluate your relationship with cooking and with him?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah, it's hard to think about what he would say because I'm not sure I want to know. I'm scared that he would tell me that I'm not good enough, that I'm a disappointment.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It seems like you're not just worried about your dad's judgment, but also about your own sense of self-worth. It's like you're carrying around this fear that if you're not good at cooking, you're not good enough as a person. Is that something that resonates with you?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah, it's like I feel like I'm not good enough as a person if I'm not good at cooking. And it's not just about cooking, it's about being a good husband, a good friend, a good person. I feel like I'm constantly trying to prove myself to others, and it's exhausting.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're using cooking as a way to measure your self-worth, and that's putting a lot of pressure on you. It's like you're trying to earn your sense of self-worth through cooking, rather than just enjoying the process. Can you imagine what it would be like if you let go of the need to be perfect at cooking, and instead focused on the joy and pleasure it brings you?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah, it's hard for me to imagine letting go of the need to be perfect at cooking, because it feels like it's tied to my sense of self-worth. But at the same time, the guilt and stress I experience when I avoid cooking is really affecting my daily life and relationships. I'm not sure what it would take for me to be able to let go of that need and just enjoy cooking.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're feeling trapped in this cycle of perfectionism and self-doubt, and it's affecting your daily life and relationships. I want to gently challenge you to consider that perfection is not the same as worthiness. Just because you're not perfect at cooking, or anything else for that matter, doesn't mean you're not a good person. Can we explore what would happen if you allowed yourself to be imperfect, and instead of focusing on the outcome, focused on the process of cooking and enjoying it for what it is, rather than what it could be?</div>

                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're feeling a sense of hopelessness and stuckness in this cycle of perfectionism and self-doubt. It's like you're trapped in a web of 'shoulds' and expectations, and it's hard to see a way out. What would it take for you to take one small step towards breaking free from this cycle and exploring what cooking could be for you, rather than about meeting someone else's expectations?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think what's hard for me is that I've always associated cooking with my dad, and it's like I'm trying to live up to his expectations, even though he's not here to see me. I feel like I'm constantly comparing myself to him and coming up short.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like your dad's presence is still very much with you, even though he's not physically here. It's like you're carrying his expectations and legacy with you, and that's making it hard for you to break free from this cycle of perfectionism and self-doubt. Can you imagine what it would be like to find a way to honor your dad's memory and legacy in a way that's authentic to you, rather than trying to live up to his expectations?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>It's funny, I never thought about it that way. I always just assumed that I needed to be good at cooking to make my dad proud, but the more we talk about this, the more I realize that I'm trying to prove myself to him, even though he's not here. It's like I'm stuck in this cycle of trying to earn his approval, and it's exhausting.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're starting to see the pattern here, and it's liberating to acknowledge that you're trying to prove yourself to your dad, even though he's not here. Can we explore what would happen if you gave yourself permission to cook for yourself, for your own enjoyment, and not for your dad's approval or your own self-doubt? What would it take for you to start cooking with a sense of curiosity, exploration, and pleasure, rather than duty or obligation?</div>

                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're feeling a sense of freedom and awareness now that you're recognizing the pattern of trying to prove yourself to your dad. Can you imagine what it would be like to start cooking with a sense of curiosity and exploration, rather than duty or obligation? What would it take for you to start experimenting with new recipes, flavors, and techniques, and to view cooking as an act of self-care and pleasure, rather than a way to earn approval?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think what's been holding me back is the fear of not meeting my dad's expectations, but now that I'm starting to see the pattern, I feel like I can start to break free from that cycle. It's like I've been carrying around this weight of responsibility to prove myself, and now I feel like I can start to let go of that and just enjoy cooking for myself.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're starting to see that your dad's approval is no longer within your control, and that you're carrying around this weight of responsibility to prove yourself to him. Can you imagine what would happen if you gave yourself permission to cook for yourself, without trying to live up to anyone else's expectations? Would you be willing to take small steps towards cooking for pleasure, rather than duty or obligation?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think I'm starting to realize that I've been living my life according to my dad's expectations, and not my own.
