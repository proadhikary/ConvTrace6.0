                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Hi Kyle, it's nice to meet you. What brings you in today?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I always assume they will say no, and it just feels pointless to even try.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're feeling a lot of frustration and hopelessness about asking for something from someone. Can you tell me more about who this someone is and what it is you're asking for? Maybe we can explore what's making you assume they'll say no.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I don't know, it's just that I've been rejected so many times before, I feel like it's just a waste of time to even try. And when I think about asking someone out, I just start feeling really anxious and stressed out.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you've had some experiences with rejection in the past, and that's really affected your confidence and willingness to take risks. Can you help me understand what you think is the underlying reason why you think people say no? Is it something about you, or is it more about the situation or the person you're asking?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I don't know, it's like... I just feel like I'm not good enough or that there's something wrong with me. Maybe I'm just not worthy of someone loving me back.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're taking the rejection personally and interpreting it as a judgment about your worth as a person. It's common to feel that way, but I want to gently challenge that idea. Can you think of any times when someone's no wasn't a reflection of your worth as a person? Maybe there were other factors at play, like them being busy or not being a good fit? Let's explore some of these past experiences and see if we can find any patterns or common themes that might help you develop a more compassionate view of yourself.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I guess so... I've had a few relationships in the past where things didn't work out, and I just assumed it was because I wasn't good enough. But thinking back, there were some pretty valid reasons why it didn't work out. Like one time, my ex was going through a tough time in their life, and it had nothing to do with me. And another time, we just had different priorities and values. But still, I always seem to take it personally and assume it's because I'm not good enough.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're recognizing that your past experiences with rejection might not be as cut and dried as you initially thought. It's great that you're willing to re-examine those situations and consider other factors that might have contributed to the end of those relationships. Can you think of how this new perspective might start to shift your feelings about asking someone out? Are you starting to feel a bit more hopeful or more willing to take a chance?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah, I guess I can see how my past experiences might not be as black and white as I thought. But it's still hard for me to shake off the feeling that I'm not good enough. I feel like I've been stuck in this cycle of negative self-talk and self-doubt for so long, it's hard to imagine changing it.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're starting to see that your past experiences with rejection might not be a reflection of your worth as a person, but it's still a deeply ingrained pattern for you. That can be a tough thing to change, but I want to encourage you that it's possible. Have you ever tried challenging those negative self-thoughts by reframing them in a more compassionate way? For example, instead of thinking I'm not good enough, could you try telling yourself I'm doing the best I can, and it's okay to make mistakes?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>It's just that I've been so used to beating myself up over these past experiences that it feels like a part of who I am now. I'm not sure how to let go of that self-criticism and start believing in myself.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It makes sense that you feel stuck in this cycle of negative self-talk and self-doubt. It's like your mind has created a familiar pattern of beating yourself up over past experiences, and it's hard to imagine doing something different. But I want to gently challenge that idea - what if you could start to rewire your brain to be kinder to yourself? Instead of beating yourself up over past mistakes, what if you could learn to acknowledge them and move forward with compassion and self-acceptance? Can you imagine what that would feel like, to be able to let go of the self-criticism and just be yourself, without judgment?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I'm not sure, it's like I've been so focused on trying to change who I am to fit into someone else's idea of what's acceptable that I've forgotten how to be kind to myself. It feels like I'm living in this constant state of self-doubt and anxiety, and I don't know how to break free from it.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're feeling trapped in this cycle of self-doubt and anxiety, and it's hard to imagine finding your way out. Can you tell me more about what you mean by trying to change who you are to fit into someone else's idea of what's acceptable? Is there a specific person or situation that's contributing to this feeling of not being able to be yourself?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think about all the times I've tried to change myself to fit in with others, to be more likable or acceptable. Like, I've always felt like I needed to be more outgoing or more confident to impress people, but the more I tried to be that person, the more I felt like I was losing myself. It's like I'm constantly trying to fit into this mold of what others expect of me, and it's exhausting.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you've been trying to conform to others' expectations of you, which has led to a sense of disconnection from your own self. Can you think of a time when you felt most like yourself, without the pressure of trying to impress others? What were you doing in that moment, and how did it feel?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>It's hard for me to think of a time when I felt truly like myself, because I've always been so focused on trying to fit in and be accepted by others. But I do remember one time when I was working on a project at work, and I was completely absorbed in it. I didn't worry about what others thought, and I just let my passion and creativity shine through. It was an amazing feeling, and I felt like I was in my element. But even thinking about that moment now, I'm worried that I'm just romanticizing it or that it was just a one-time thing. I don't know if I can ever truly be myself without feeling like I'm being judged or rejected.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're struggling to recall a time when you felt truly like yourself, without the influence of others' expectations. That's understandable, given the patterns of self-doubt and anxiety you've developed. But I want to encourage you to explore that moment when you were working on the project at work, and you felt completely absorbed and passionate about it. What was it about that experience that felt so authentic and fulfilling to you? Was there a sense of freedom or autonomy that came with being able to express yourself without worrying about what others thought? Let's dive deeper into that moment and see if we can uncover some clues about what it takes for you to feel like yourself, without the pressure of trying to impress others.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I'm not sure, it's like I've been so focused on trying to change who I am to fit into someone else's idea of what's acceptable that I've forgotten how to be kind to myself. It feels like I'm living in this constant state of self-doubt and anxiety, and I don't know how to break free from it.</div>

I want to gently challenge the idea that you need to change who you are to fit into someone else's idea of what's acceptable. Can you imagine what it would be like to let go of that pressure and just be yourself, without judgment? What would that feel like in your body? Would you be able to take a deep breath and relax into your own skin?</div>

                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think I'm starting to see that my fear of rejection is not just about the person I'm asking out, but about my own self-worth.

I want to gently challenge the idea that you need to constantly prove yourself to yourself.
