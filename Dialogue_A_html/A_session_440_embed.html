                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Hi Brian, thank you for coming in today. How are you feeling right now?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>It's just frustrating. I mean, I've always enjoyed fishing, but after that last trip, I can't shake off this feeling of being completely useless at it.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like that last fishing trip was really disappointing for you, and it's not just about the trip itself, but about how it's affecting your sense of self-efficacy. Can you tell me more about what happened on that trip that's making you feel so useless at fishing?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I don't know, it just felt like I did everything wrong. I went to the wrong spot, I chose the wrong bait, and I didn't even get a single bite. I just felt like a complete failure. And now every time I think about going fishing again, I feel that same sense of dread and anxiety. It's like I'm just not cut out for it.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like that experience was really overwhelming for you and has left you with a lot of self-doubt. It's interesting that you're beating yourself up over it, though. Can you help me understand what you mean by 'everything wrong'? Was there something specific that happened that made you feel like you failed, or was it more of a general feeling?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I don't know, it's just that feeling of being completely incompetent, like I have no idea what I'm doing. And now every time I think about going fishing again, I feel like I'm going to fail all over again. It's like I've lost my confidence, my sense of self-worth, and my ability to enjoy fishing.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're not just beating yourself up over specific mistakes you made during the trip, but you're also beating yourself up over your perceived lack of ability or competence in general. It's like you're saying to yourself, I'm just not cut out for this. Can you help me understand what's driving this sense of inadequacy? Is it something that's been building up over time, or is it a new feeling for you?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah, I guess it's just been building up over time. I've always been pretty self-critical, but this fishing trip really brought it to a head. I just feel like I'm not good enough, no matter what I do. And it's not just fishing, it's everything. I feel like I'm just not competent enough to do anything right.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like this experience has triggered a deeper sense of self-doubt and inadequacy that goes beyond just fishing. It's like you're carrying around this critical inner voice that's always telling you you're not good enough. Can you help me understand what you think this critical voice is based on? Is it something that's been instilled in you by others, or is it something that's come from your own expectations?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah, I don't know, it's just that feeling of being completely incompetent, like I have no idea what I'm doing.

                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're struggling with a deep-seated sense of inadequacy that's not just limited to fishing. It's like you're carrying around this critical inner voice that's always telling you you're not good enough. I'm wondering, have you always felt this way, or is this a more recent development?</div>

                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like this sense of inadequacy has been building up over time, and this fishing trip was the straw that broke the camel's back. It's like you're carrying around this heavy burden of self-doubt and criticism, and it's affecting not just your fishing, but every area of your life. I'm wondering, have you noticed any patterns or common themes that trigger this critical inner voice? Is it when you're facing a new challenge, or when you're trying to do something that's outside of your comfort zone?</div>

                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I don't know why I always do this to myself. I mean, I'm a paramedic, for crying out loud! I'm supposed to be someone who can handle pressure and stay calm under fire. But when it comes to fishing, I completely fall apart. It's like I'm a completely different person. And it's not just fishing, it's everything. I feel like I'm just not good enough, no matter what I do.</div>
