                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Hi Gwen, welcome to our session today. How are you feeling?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I've just been feeling really down about my efforts to be healthy as a vegan. It's like no matter what I do, I just can't seem to get it right, and it's frustrating.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're really struggling with the feeling of frustration and disappointment around your vegan lifestyle. Can you tell me more about what specifically is feeling off or wrong to you? Is it the food, the social aspects, or something else entirely?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Honestly, it's more about the social aspects and comparing myself to others. I feel like I'm constantly looking at others who seem healthier and more successful with their vegan lifestyle, and it makes me feel like I'm failing. I also get a lot of pressure from friends and family to be perfect with my diet, and it's hard to keep up with the expectations.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're feeling a lot of pressure to conform to certain standards or expectations around being a vegan, and that's causing you a lot of stress and self-doubt. Can you tell me more about what these expectations are, and where they're coming from? Is it internalized pressure from yourself, or is it mainly coming from others?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah, it's definitely a mix of both. I think I put a lot of pressure on myself to be perfect, but also my friends and family can be pretty critical and unsupportive when I'm not meeting their expectations. It's hard to balance all of that and still feel good about myself.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're caught in this web of both internal and external pressures, and it's really taking a toll on your mental well-being. Can we explore this idea of perfectionism a bit more? What does being perfect as a vegan mean to you, and how do you think that's impacting your daily life and feelings of self-worth?</div>

                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like the idea of being perfect as a vegan is really heavy for you, and it's causing a lot of stress and self-doubt. Is it possible that being perfect as a vegan isn't actually possible, and maybe it's not about being perfect at all? Maybe it's about finding a way to live your values and make choices that feel true to you, even if they're not perfect?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah, I never thought about it that way. It's like, I've been so focused on being perfect that I haven't stopped to think about what being a vegan really means to me. Maybe it's not about being perfect, but about being true to myself and making choices that align with my values. That's a really hard concept for me to wrap my head around, but it's also kind of freeing to think about.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're carrying a heavy burden of expectation, both from yourself and others, and it's affecting your mental well-being. It takes a lot of courage to acknowledge this and be willing to challenge these expectations. I'd like to explore this idea of being true to yourself and your values further. What do you think would happen if you let go of the need to be perfect and instead focused on making choices that align with your values, even if they're not perfect? How might that change your relationship with being a vegan and with yourself?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>That's a really good point. I think if I let go of the need to be perfect, I would feel a sense of relief and freedom. I would be able to make choices that align with my values and not feel guilty or ashamed about not being perfect.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're already starting to shift your perspective and recognize that perfection might not be the goal. Can we explore what kind of choices you might make if you weren't worried about being perfect as a vegan? Would you be more likely to try new recipes, spend time with friends who share your values, or prioritize your own well-being over external expectations?</div>

                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think that would make a huge difference. I would be more likely to try new recipes and not be so hard on myself if they don't turn out perfectly. I would also prioritize my own well-being over external expectations and spend more time with friends who share my values.</div>

                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think it's funny that I've been so focused on being perfect that I haven't stopped to think about what being a vegan really means to me.
