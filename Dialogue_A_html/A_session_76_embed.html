                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Hi Gina, it's nice to meet you. How are you feeling today?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I'm feeling a bit overwhelmed, to be honest. The incident during the rehearsal has really taken a toll on me, and I can't seem to shake off these feelings of inadequacy.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>I'm so sorry to hear that, Gina. It sounds like a really difficult experience. Can you tell me more about what happened during the rehearsal that's been weighing on your mind? What were you feeling in that moment?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>That day, I was feeling a lot of pressure to perform perfectly, and I was trying to focus on my steps and movements. But then, out of nowhere, this other dancer came running towards me, and I didn't have time to react. She accidentally knocked me down, and I felt a rush of fear and helplessness. Since then, I've been replaying that moment in my head, wondering what I could have done differently to prevent it.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Gina, it sounds like that incident was incredibly traumatic for you. It's no wonder you're feeling overwhelmed and inadequate. It's like your brain is stuck on replay, reliving that moment over and over. Can you tell me more about what you mean by what I could have done differently? What are some of the thoughts that are running through your head during these replays?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>That's a great point, counselor. I think I've been replaying that moment in my head, trying to make sense of what happened. I keep thinking that if I had been more focused, if I had anticipated her movement better, if I had been more prepared, maybe I could have avoided the fall. But now, every time I think about it, I feel like I'm reliving that moment all over again, and it's like my brain is stuck in this loop of self-blame and inadequacy.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're experiencing a lot of self-doubt and self-criticism, wondering what you could have done differently to prevent the incident. Can you tell me more about what you mean by I could have been more prepared? What specific things do you think you should have done to prevent the fall, and what does it mean to you that you didn't do them?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>That's a great question, counselor. I think I've been replaying that moment in my head, trying to make sense of what happened. I keep thinking that if I had been more focused, if I had anticipated her movement better, if I had been more prepared, maybe I could have avoided the fall. But now, every time I think about it, I feel like I'm reliving that moment all over again, and it's like my brain is stuck in this loop of self-blame and inadequacy.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're placing a lot of responsibility on yourself to have prevented the fall, and that you're beating yourself up over it. Can you explore with me why you think it's so important to have been prepared and focused? What does it mean to you that you didn't meet your own expectations in that moment?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think I'm putting too much pressure on myself to be perfect, and when I'm not, I feel like I've failed. It's like I'm trying to control everything, and when something goes wrong, it's like my whole world comes crashing down. I'm not sure why I think I need to be so perfect, but it's like this voice in my head is constantly nagging me, telling me I'm not good enough.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like this pressure to be perfect is really rooted in a deep-seated fear of not being good enough. It's like you're constantly trying to prove yourself to yourself, and when you don't meet your own expectations, it's like you're experiencing a sense of shame or inadequacy. Can you explore with me what this voice in your head is trying to say? What does it mean to you to be good enough?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>That's a really good point, counselor. I think this voice in my head is trying to say that I'm not worthy of success or happiness unless I'm perfect. It's like I'm constantly comparing myself to others and trying to measure up, and when I don't, I feel like I've let myself down.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Gina, it sounds like this voice in your head is trying to control your self-worth by dictating what it means to be good enough. It's like you're trying to prove to yourself that you're worthy of success and happiness by being perfect. Can you imagine what would happen if you let go of this need for perfection and allowed yourself to be imperfect? What would it feel like to be kinder to yourself and acknowledge that mistakes are a natural part of life?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think I'm trying to control everything because I'm afraid of not being in control, and when something goes wrong, it's like my whole world comes crashing down. It's like I'm trying to prove to myself that I'm worthy of success and happiness by being perfect, and if I'm not perfect, then I'm not good enough.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're carrying a heavy burden of self-criticism and perfectionism, Gina. It's as if you're trying to control every aspect of your life to avoid feeling like you're not good enough. I want you to know that it's okay to make mistakes, and it's okay to not be perfect. In fact, it's often our imperfections that make us human and relatable. Can you imagine what it would be like to give yourself permission to be imperfect and make mistakes? What would it feel like to be kinder to yourself and acknowledge that you're doing the best you can?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>It's funny, counselor, because I think I've been so focused on trying to control everything that I've forgotten what it's like to be kind to myself. I keep replaying that moment in my head, trying to make sense of what happened, but I think I'm missing the point. I'm not focusing on what I can learn from the experience or how I can improve, but instead, I'm stuck in this loop of self-blame and inadequacy. I think I need to start practicing self-compassion and acknowledging that mistakes are a natural part of life. It's okay to make mistakes, and it's okay to not be perfect.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're really struggling with this feeling of inadequacy and self-criticism, Gina.

                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Gina, I can see how overwhelmed and stuck you feel. It sounds like you're trapped in this cycle of self-blame and inadequacy, replaying the incident in your head and beating yourself up over what you think you could have done differently. I want to gently suggest that maybe it's not about being perfect, but rather about being human. Maybe it's okay to make mistakes and learn from them, rather than beating yourself up over them. What do you think it would be like to give yourself permission to be imperfect and make mistakes?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>That's a really powerful realization, counselor.
