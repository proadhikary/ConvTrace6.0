                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Hello Samuel, it's nice to meet you. How can I help you today?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Hello, it's good to be here. Well, I've been struggling with a deep sense of despair and pessimism because I have always wanted to write a book, but I feel like I'm running out of time because of my age.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Can you tell me more about what's driving this feeling of despair and pessimism? Is it the fear of not achieving your goal, or is it something else entirely?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yes, I think it's a combination of both. The fear of not achieving my goal is definitely a significant contributor, but I also feel like I'm constantly being compared to younger authors who have already achieved success, which makes me feel like I'm already behind. It's like I'm constantly playing catch-up, and it's hard to feel motivated when I feel like I'm already at a disadvantage because of my age.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Can you help me understand more about these comparisons you're making to younger authors? What is it about their success that's particularly difficult for you to hear or see? Is it the feeling that you're not living up to your own expectations, or is it more about the perceived competition or pressure to keep up with others?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>That's a great question. I think it's a combination of both, to be honest. On one hand, I do feel like I'm not living up to my own expectations, and it's hard for me to see others achieving success at a younger age when I'm still struggling to make progress on my book. On the other hand, I also feel like there's this pressure to keep up with others, to prove myself, and to show that I'm still relevant and capable, even at my age. It's like I'm constantly trying to prove myself, and it's exhausting.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're feeling a sense of competition and pressure to keep up with others, which is adding to your feelings of despair and pessimism. Can you help me understand why you feel like you need to prove yourself to others, or to yourself? What is it about being a writer that you feel like you need to prove in order to feel validated or successful?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>That's a great point, and I think it's something that I've never really taken the time to think about before. I think, for me, being a writer is not just about writing a book, it's about being recognized and validated as a writer. I feel like if I don't write a bestselling book, then I'm not a real writer, and that's a scary thought for me. But, at the same time, I also feel like if I do write a bestselling book, then people will expect me to keep writing at the same level, and that's a pressure that I don't feel like I'm ready to handle.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like a big part of your identity is tied up in being a writer, and you're seeking validation and recognition from others to feel like you're a real writer. It's understandable that you'd feel this way, given the importance you place on writing. Can you tell me more about what you think it means to be a real writer? Is it about writing a certain kind of book, or is it about having a certain level of success or recognition?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>That's a great point, and I think it's something that I've never really taken the time to think about before.

                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like being a real writer means achieving a certain level of success and recognition, and that you're worried that if you don't meet those expectations, you'll feel like you're not a real writer at all. Can you help me understand what you think will happen if you don't achieve that level of success? What does it mean to you to be a real writer, and what would make you feel like you're truly a writer, regardless of whether you write a bestselling book or not?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think, for me, being a real writer would mean that I've written a book that resonates with people, that they can relate to, and that it makes a positive impact on their lives.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like being a real writer is deeply tied to the idea of making a meaningful connection with others through your work. You're not just looking for external validation, but also a sense of purpose and fulfillment. Can you help me understand what it is about making a positive impact on people's lives that resonates with you? Is it the idea that you're leaving a lasting legacy, or is it more about feeling like you're doing something that's truly meaningful and valuable?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think that making a positive impact on people's lives is what gives me a sense of purpose and fulfillment as a writer. It's not just about writing a book that sells well, but about writing something that can change someone's perspective or help them through a difficult time. When I think about the books that have had a profound impact on me, it's not just the writing itself, but the way it made me feel and the way it changed my perspective. I think that's what I'm looking for as a writer, and that's what would make me feel like I'm truly making a difference.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like making a positive impact on people's lives is what truly drives your sense of purpose and fulfillment as a writer. Can you help me understand what specific experiences or stories have led you to this realization? What is it about the books that have had a profound impact on you that resonates with you, and how do you think you can incorporate those same elements into your own writing?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think that the realization that writing a book is not just about achieving success, but about making a positive impact on people's lives, has given me a new perspective on what it means to be a real writer. It's not about the external validation or recognition, but about the connection I can make with others through my work. I feel like this newfound understanding has taken some of the pressure off, and I'm starting to feel more motivated to write because I'm focusing on the purpose behind it rather than the outcome.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you've had a profound realization about what it means to be a writer, and it's shifted your focus from external validation to making a meaningful connection with others.

What specific changes do you think you'll make, and how do you envision your writing changing as a result of this newfound understanding?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think that by focusing on the purpose behind my writing, I can start to let go of the pressure to write a bestselling book and instead focus on creating something that resonates with people. I want to write a book that can be a source of comfort, inspiration, or guidance for others, and I think that's what will give me a sense of fulfillment and purpose as a writer. I also want to start exploring different genres and styles of writing to see what works best for me, and to challenge myself to try new things and grow as a writer.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're feeling a sense of relief and renewed motivation after having this realization about what it means to be a writer.

                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think that this newfound understanding has given me a sense of clarity and direction. I want to start by setting specific goals for my writing that align with my purpose of making a positive impact on others. For instance, I could aim to write a chapter a week, or to write a certain number of words each day. I also want to start finding ways to connect with readers and get feedback on my work, such as joining a writing group or sharing my work with a beta reader. Additionally, I want to start exploring different genres and styles of writing to see what works best for me, and to challenge myself to try new things and grow as a writer.</div>
