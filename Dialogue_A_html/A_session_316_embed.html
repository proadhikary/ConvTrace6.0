                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Hello Wendy, thank you for coming in today. How can I assist you?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Hi, thank you for seeing me. I've been struggling with self-doubt and feelings of inadequacy, especially when it comes to my computer-building skills. It's been really affecting my motivation and confidence.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>I see. It sounds like you're really struggling with self-doubt and feelings of inadequacy, especially in an area where you're trying to demonstrate expertise, like computer-building. Can you tell me more about what's been going on that's making you feel this way? Has something specific happened recently that's triggered these feelings?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah, I think it's just been building up over time. Lately, I've been getting more positive feedback from friends about my computer-building skills, but instead of feeling more confident, it's actually made me feel more anxious and worried that I'm not good enough. It's like, the more I learn and accomplish, the more I feel like I'm not doing it right.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like the feedback you're getting is actually having a negative impact on your self-perception, rather than a positive one. It's like you're putting pressure on yourself to be perfect or else you'll fail. Can you help me understand what's driving this sense of not being good enough? Is there something specific that you're worried about not doing right, or is it more of a general feeling?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah, I think it's just this feeling that I'm not good enough, that I'm just pretending to be something I'm not. Like, I've always been a mechanic, and I'm good at it, but computer building is this whole different thing, and I'm worried that people will find out I'm not as good as I claim to be. It's like, I'm living this lie, and it's eating away at me.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're carrying a lot of weight on your shoulders, wondering if you're truly proficient in computer building or if you're just pretending to be. It's like you're comparing your past experiences as a mechanic to this new skill, and feeling like you're not measuring up. Can you tell me more about what's driving this fear of being found out? Is it the fear of being seen as incompetent, or is it something deeper?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah, I think it's a mix of both. I'm worried that people will think I'm fake, that I'm just trying to be something I'm not, and that's really scary for me. But I'm also worried that if I do get caught, I won't be able to handle it, that I'll crumble under the pressure. It's like, I'm trapped in this web of self-doubt, and I don't know how to get out.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're carrying a significant amount of anxiety and self-doubt, and it's affecting your daily life. It's understandable that you're worried about being seen as incompetent or fake, and that fear can be overwhelming. Can you help me understand what would happen if you did get caught, or if people did find out that you're not as good at computer building as you claim to be? What would be the worst-case scenario for you?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>That's a tough one. I think if I got caught, I would feel like I've failed not just myself, but also others who have believed in me. I would feel like I've let them down, and that would be hard to live with. It's not just about being caught, it's about the fear of not being good enough, of not being able to measure up to the expectations of others.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like the fear of not meeting others' expectations is a significant driver of your self-doubt and anxiety. It's like you're carrying a heavy burden of responsibility to live up to others' perceptions of you. Can you help me understand why you feel like you need to live up to these expectations? Is it because you want to be liked or respected by others, or is it because you're trying to prove something to yourself?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah, I think it's a mix of both. I want to be liked and respected by others, but at the same time, I'm trying to prove to myself that I'm capable of doing something new and different. I guess I'm trying to prove that I'm more than just a mechanic, that I'm capable of learning and growing.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're carrying a lot of pressure to live up to others' expectations, and also to prove something to yourself. It's like you're trying to fit into this mold of being a certain way, and that's causing a lot of stress and anxiety for you. Can you help me understand what would happen if you didn't have to live up to these expectations? What would it be like if you could just be yourself, without the need to prove anything to anyone?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think about it, and it's scary to imagine not having to live up to others' expectations, but at the same time, it's also kind of freeing. I wouldn't have to worry about being judged or criticized, and I could just focus on doing what I love without all the added pressure. But I'm not sure I could do that, I've always been someone who tries to please others, it's hard for me to let go of that need to be accepted.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're carrying a lot of weight on your shoulders, trying to live up to others' expectations and also prove something to yourself. It's like you're trapped in this cycle of trying to be perfect, and it's exhausting. Can you help me understand what would happen if you let go of that need to please others and just focused on being yourself? What would that look like for you?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>That's a tough one, because I think that's a big part of who I am, trying to please others and live up to their expectations. But at the same time, it's also like I'm losing myself in the process. I'm not sure what being myself would even look like, because I've always been trying to fit into this mold of being a certain way.</div>

                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think I've been trying to prove something to others, to myself, and to my past self. I've always been a mechanic, and I think I've been trying to prove that I'm more than just a mechanic. I've been trying to prove that I can learn new things, that I can adapt, and that I'm not just stuck in one place. But at the same time, I think I've been trying to prove it to myself, to show myself that I'm capable of doing something new and different. It's like I'm trying to prove my own worth, and that's a heavy burden to carry.</div>

                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think that would be incredibly liberating. Not having to prove my worth to anyone would allow me to focus on the process of learning and growing without the added pressure of needing to show off my skills. It would be nice to be able to explore and discover new things without the fear of being judged or criticized. I think it would allow me to tap into my true passions and interests, and pursue them without the burden of needing to prove myself to others.</div>
