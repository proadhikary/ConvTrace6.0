                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Hi Violet, it's nice to meet you. How are you feeling about being here today?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I'm feeling a bit mixed. Part of me is hopeful, but another part is skeptical if this will actually help.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Violet, it sounds like you're experiencing a bit of ambivalence, which is completely normal when considering seeking help. It's great that you're acknowledging both your hopes and doubts, as that takes a lot of courage. Can you tell me more about what's leading you to feel hopeful about being here, and what specifically is making you skeptical?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Honestly, I'm hoping that counseling can help me figure out why I'm always so hard on myself and why I tend to blow things out of proportion. I've tried positive affirmations and journaling, but they don't seem to stick. I'm skeptical because I've been stuck in this pattern for so long, and I've tried to overcome it before without much success. Plus, I've always been a bit of a perfectionist, and the thought of not being able to control my thoughts and emotions is unsettling.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>That makes sense. It sounds like you're hoping that counseling can help you break free from this pattern of self-criticism and proportionality, and you're concerned that you've tried other methods before without success. The idea of not being able to control your thoughts and emotions can be really overwhelming for a perfectionist like yourself. Can you tell me more about what it's like when you're being hard on yourself? What are some of the thoughts you're having, and how do you usually try to push through those feelings?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah, I guess it's like when I'm trying to surf, and I catch a wave, but then I wipe out. I'll immediately think to myself, You're such a failure, you'll never be able to catch a wave again. And then I'll start replaying all the times I've wiped out in my head, and I'll feel like I'm just a total disappointment. It's like my mind is constantly replaying these negative scenarios, and it's hard to shake off. Sometimes, I'll try to distract myself by doing something else, like playing the piano or going for a walk, but the thoughts always come back eventually.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Violet, it sounds like when you're being hard on yourself, you're experiencing a lot of self-criticism and negative self-talk. It's like your mind is constantly replaying these negative scenarios, and it's hard to shake off. It's understandable that you want to try to distract yourself with other activities, but it's clear that the thoughts come back eventually. Can you tell me more about what you think is driving these negative self-thoughts? Is there something specific that you're worried about or trying to achieve that's making you feel this way?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah, I think it's just the pressure to be perfect, you know? I want to be the best surfer, the best bartender, the best pianist. I feel like if I'm not excelling in all these areas, I'm a failure. And I guess that fear of failure is what drives these negative thoughts. I'm always thinking about what could go wrong, what I could do better, and it's hard to just relax and enjoy the moment.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like the pressure to be perfect is a significant driver of your self-criticism and negative self-talk. It's like you're constantly striving for excellence in multiple areas of your life, and when you don't meet those high standards, you feel like a failure. Can you tell me more about where this pressure to be perfect comes from? Is it something that's been instilled in you by others, or is it more of an internalized expectation?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah, I think it's a combination of both. Growing up, my parents always pushed me to be my best and did a lot of reinforcement for achievements. And as I got older, I started to internalize those expectations and feel like I had to constantly be improving and excelling. It's like I'm always trying to live up to this idealized version of myself, and when I don't meet that standard, I feel like a failure.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Violet, it sounds like the pressure to be perfect is deeply ingrained in your upbringing and has been internalized over time. It's no wonder that you're struggling with self-criticism and negative self-talk, given the high expectations you've set for yourself. Can you tell me more about what it's like to live with this constant pressure to be perfect? How does it affect your daily life and relationships?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah, it's like I'm always walking on eggshells, waiting for something to go wrong. I'm constantly worried about making mistakes and not meeting expectations. It's exhausting, and it's hard to enjoy the things I love, like surfing and playing the piano, because I'm always thinking about what could go wrong. It's also affected my relationships with friends and colleagues, because I'm always so focused on trying to be perfect that I don't have time for them.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like this pressure to be perfect has become a pervasive presence in your life, affecting not only your self-talk but also your relationships and daily experiences. It's as if you're constantly living in a state of hypervigilance, waiting for something to go wrong. Can you tell me more about what it would mean for you to let go of this need for perfection and allow yourself to be more imperfect and human? What would that look like for you, and what are some small steps you could take to start moving in that direction?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think it would mean embracing my imperfections and being kinder to myself when I mess up. It's hard for me to imagine a life where I'm not constantly striving for perfection, but the thought of being able to enjoy the things I love without the weight of expectations is really appealing. I'm not sure what small steps I could take to start moving in that direction, but I'm willing to try.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It takes a lot of courage to acknowledge the pressure you're putting on yourself to be perfect, Violet. It sounds like you're carrying a heavy burden, and it's affecting many areas of your life. I want to acknowledge that it's okay to make mistakes and that it's okay to not be perfect. In fact, it's often our imperfections that make us more human and relatable. I'd like to explore this idea of embracing your imperfections and being kinder to yourself when you mess up. Can you tell me what you think would happen if you started to let go of this need for perfection? Would you feel a sense of freedom or relief? Would you be able to enjoy the things you love without the weight of expectations? And what small steps do you think you could take to start moving in that direction?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think if I let go of the need for perfection, I would feel a sense of freedom and relief. I would no longer be stuck in this constant cycle of striving and self-criticism. I would be able to enjoy the things I love without the weight of expectations, like surfing and playing the piano. I would be able to make mistakes and learn from them without beating myself up over them. I would be able to be more present and mindful in the moment, rather than constantly worrying about what could go wrong.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like letting go of the need for perfection would mean embracing your imperfections and being kinder to yourself when you mess up.

                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think one step I could take is to start practicing self-compassion. Instead of beating myself up over mistakes, I could try to be kinder and more understanding towards myself. Maybe I could write down positive affirmations about myself and post them around my room, or take a few deep breaths when I start to feel anxious or self-critical. I also think it would be helpful to set smaller, more achievable goals for myself, rather than trying to be perfect all the time. And maybe I could try to focus on the present moment, rather than worrying about the future or past.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Violet, I really appreciate your willingness to explore this idea of embracing your imperfections and being kinder to yourself when you mess up. It's a brave and vulnerable place to be, and I'm here to support you through this process. Let's break down some of the small steps you mentioned.

I could start by writing down positive affirmations about myself and posting them around my room, or taking a few deep breaths when I start to feel anxious or self-critical. I could also try to reframe my thoughts in a more positive light, like instead of thinking I'm a failure, I could think I made a mistake, but I can learn from it.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Violet, it sounds like practicing self-compassion would involve being kinder and more understanding towards yourself when you make mistakes.

That's a great way to cultivate a more compassionate mindset towards yourself. Can you tell me more about what would happen if you started to practice self-compassion in your daily life? How do you think it would affect your self-talk, your relationships, and your overall sense of well-being?</div>

                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think it's interesting that you're pointing out how my need for perfection is deeply ingrained in my upbringing and has been internalized over time. It makes sense that I'm struggling to break free from it because it's such a strong part of my identity. I'm not sure what small steps I could take to start moving in the direction of embracing my imperfections and being kinder to myself when I mess up.

Noticing when you're being self-critical and taking a step back to reframe your thoughts in a more positive light is a great place to start. This might involve practicing mindfulness or meditation to help you become more aware of your thoughts and emotions.Focusing on the present moment can also be a powerful way to shift your perspective. Instead of constantly worrying about the future or past, you could try to bring your attention to the present moment. This might involve engaging your senses, like taking a few deep breaths or paying attention to the sensation of your feet on the ground.It's also important to remember that self-compassion is not about being self-indulgent or making excuses. It's about being kind and understanding towards yourself, even when you make mistakes. This can involve treating yourself with the same kindness and care that you would offer to a close friend.I'd like to challenge you to try one of these small steps this week. See how it feels to reframe your thoughts in a more positive light, or focus on the present moment. We can discuss how it goes and make adjustments as needed.</div>

One idea could be to write down three positive affirmations about yourself each day, like I am capable of learning from my mistakes or I am strong and resilient. Another idea could be to take a few deep breaths when you start to feel anxious or self-critical, to calm your nervous system and shift your perspective.Remember, the goal isn't to eliminate self-criticism entirely, but rather to learn how to respond to it in a more compassionate and kind way. By reframing your thoughts and practicing self-compassion, you can start to break free from the cycle of self-criticism and perfectionism that's been holding you back.Let's check in next session to see how it goes and make adjustments as needed.</div>
