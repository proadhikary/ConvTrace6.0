                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Hi Heather, it's nice to meet you. How are you feeling today?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>It's just been really tough to keep up with everything. The workload is never-ending, and it's like no matter what I do, I can't catch a break.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>I can imagine how overwhelming that must feel. It sounds like you're feeling like you're constantly running on a treadmill and getting nowhere. Can you tell me more about what's specifically feeling like it's piling up and causing you the most stress? Is it work-related tasks, personal responsibilities, or something else entirely?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Look, I don't know why I'm here. I just feel like I'm stuck in this never-ending cycle of work and no time for myself. It's like, I get it, work is important, but so are my hobbies and my well-being. But no one seems to care about that. They just want me to keep pushing and producing more and more. And honestly, I don't know how much more of this I can take.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're feeling really unheard and unseen in your current situation. It's like your well-being and personal needs are being neglected. Can you tell me more about what your hobbies and self-care activities used to look like before this cycle of overwork took over, and what you miss about those times?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah, it's like no one cares about my happiness or my well-being. They only care about how much I can produce for the company. And honestly, it's like, what's the point of even having hobbies or personal interests if I'm just going to be too exhausted to enjoy them? It's like, I'm just a machine, you know?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're feeling like your humanity is being lost in the process of just trying to keep up with work demands. It's like you're being reduced to just a cog in a machine, rather than a person with thoughts, feelings, and desires. Can you tell me more about what kind of hobbies and self-care activities you used to enjoy, and how you think they contributed to your sense of identity and fulfillment?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Client:</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like those hobbies and self-care activities were an important part of who you are and how you found meaning and purpose. You mentioned that you miss those times. Can you tell me more about what specifically you miss about those times? Was it the sense of relaxation and calm that came with doing something you enjoyed, or was it the sense of accomplishment and pride that came with pursuing your passions?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>It's like, I don't even know who I am anymore. I used to be this person who loved working on cars and trying new beers, and now I feel like I'm just a shell of that person. I miss the sense of accomplishment and pride I got from doing those things, but most of all, I miss the sense of relaxation and calm that came with it. It's like, I used to be able to unwind and just be myself, but now I'm just constantly stressed and anxious about work.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're missing the sense of relaxation and calm that you used to experience when you were pursuing your hobbies and self-care activities. It's like, you're craving a sense of stillness and tranquility that's been taken away from you. Can you tell me more about what you think would need to happen for you to regain that sense of calm and relaxation, and to feel like you're being the person you used to be?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I don't know, it just feels like I'm stuck in this never-ending cycle of stress and anxiety. I've tried to make time for my hobbies, but it always seems to get pushed aside. I feel like I'm losing myself in all of this.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're feeling a deep sense of loss and disconnection from your authentic self. You're craving the sense of calm and relaxation that you used to experience when you were pursuing your hobbies and self-care activities. Can you imagine a scenario where you're able to carve out time for yourself, doing something that brings you joy and fulfillment? What would that look like, and what small steps could you take to make that a reality?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>It's hard for me to even imagine a scenario where I have time for myself, because I feel like work is always getting in the way. But I guess if I had to imagine it, it would be me being able to wake up early and spend some time working on my car, or trying out new beers and exploring new breweries. It would be nice to have that sense of freedom and autonomy to do what I want, when I want. But it feels like that's just a pipe dream right now.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're craving a sense of freedom and autonomy to pursue your passions and interests, without the burden of work-related responsibilities. You're longing for a sense of calm and relaxation, and a connection to your authentic self. Can you imagine what it would be like to have a daily routine that includes time for yourself, doing things that bring you joy and fulfillment? Perhaps we could start by exploring small, manageable steps that you could take to carve out just 15-20 minutes a day for yourself, doing something that brings you joy. What do you think would be the first step you would take to make that a reality?</div>

What would need to change in your daily routine or work environment for you to feel like you can pursue your hobbies and interests without guilt or shame?</div>

I used to be the person who loved working on cars and trying new beers, and now I feel like I've lost that sense of identity. I miss being able to do things just for me, without feeling guilty or ashamed. I want to get back to that place where I can be myself and not feel like I'm just a slave to my job.</div>
