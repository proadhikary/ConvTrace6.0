                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Hi, Austin. Thanks for coming in today. How are you feeling?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I'm feeling a bit nervous, but I'm good. Thanks for asking. I wanted to talk about how I've been struggling with negative self-labeling, especially when I make mistakes. It's really affecting my confidence and keeping me from enjoying activities I used to love, like playing softball.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>That sounds really tough, Austin. It's like you're putting a lot of pressure on yourself to be perfect, and when you make a mistake, you're beating yourself up over it. Can you tell me more about what kind of things you're saying to yourself when this happens? What are some of the specific thoughts that come up for you?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah, that's a great way to put it. When I make a mistake, I usually tell myself something like, You're such a failure, you'll never be good enough. And then I'll start thinking about all the times I've messed up in the past and how I'll probably mess up again in the future. It's like my mind is constantly replaying all these negative thoughts and it's hard to shake them off.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>That sounds like a really critical inner voice, Austin. It's like you're using extreme language and generalizing from a single mistake to conclude that you're a failure. Have you noticed if these thoughts are more about the past or the future, or if they're more focused on the present moment?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>That's a great observation, counselor. I think my mind is mostly focused on the future, because I'm always worried about making mistakes in the future and being judged by others. The past is just a constant reminder of all the times I've messed up, but I'm trying to move forward and avoid making the same mistakes again.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're carrying around a lot of anxiety about the future and what others might think of you, and that's really affecting your present moment experience. Can you tell me more about what you mean by being judged by others? What specific people or situations make you feel like you're being judged, and how do you think they might be judging you?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>That's a great point, counselor. I think I'm constantly worried about what my teammates might think of me if I make a mistake during a game. I'm also concerned about what my friends might think of me if they find out I'm not as good at something as they are. It's like I'm always trying to impress others and avoid being seen as weak or incompetent.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're carrying around a lot of anxiety about what others might think of you, and that's really impacting your confidence and ability to enjoy activities. It's understandable that you want to impress others and avoid being seen as weak or incompetent, but it's also important to remember that everyone makes mistakes and it's okay not to be perfect. Can you think of any times when you've made a mistake and someone close to you has still accepted and supported you, even though you were worried they might judge you?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>That's a great point, counselor. I think of my mom, she's always been very supportive and understanding when I make mistakes. She never makes me feel like I'm a failure or that I'll never be good enough. She just tells me that everyone makes mistakes and that it's okay to learn from them. When she says things like that, it really helps me to feel more confident and less anxious about making mistakes. It's like she's reminding me that it's okay to be imperfect and that I don't have to be perfect all the time.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>That's wonderful, Austin. It sounds like your mom has been a source of comfort and support for you, and that's really special. It's great that you can recall a specific time when she helped you feel more confident and less anxious. Can you think of ways you might be able to apply that same kind of self-compassion and understanding to yourself when you make mistakes, rather than beating yourself up over them?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah, that's a great point, counselor. I think I can start by practicing some self-compassion when I make mistakes. Maybe I can remind myself that everyone makes mistakes and that it's okay not to be perfect. I can also try to focus on what I did well and what I learned from the experience, rather than dwelling on what went wrong. And when I'm feeling anxious or critical, I can try to reframe my thoughts by telling myself that I'm doing the best I can and that it's okay to make mistakes.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're already taking some great steps towards self-compassion, Austin. Reminding yourself that everyone makes mistakes and that it's okay not to be perfect can be a huge relief. And reframing your thoughts by focusing on what you did well and what you learned from the experience can help you stay positive and moving forward. Can you think of a specific situation where you might be able to put these strategies into practice, like if you make a mistake during a softball game?</div>

                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think I can start by practicing these strategies during my next softball game. For example, if I make a mistake and my teammates start to get frustrated, I can remind myself that everyone makes mistakes and that it's okay not to be perfect. I can also focus on what I did well during the game and what I learned from the experience, instead of dwelling on my mistake. And when I'm feeling anxious or critical, I can try to reframe my thoughts by telling myself that I'm doing the best I can and that it's okay to make mistakes.</div>

Reminding yourself that everyone makes mistakes and that it's okay not to be perfect can be a huge relief. And reframing your thoughts by focusing on what you did well and what you learned from the experience can help you stay positive and moving forward. I'm curious, what do you think would happen if you started to practice self-compassion and reframing your thoughts in the moment, during the softball game? Would you be able to let go of some of that anxiety and pressure to be perfect, and just focus on playing and having fun?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>That's a great question, counselor. I think if I started practicing self-compassion and reframing my thoughts during the softball game, I would be able to let go of some of that anxiety and pressure to be perfect. I would be able to focus on playing and having fun, and not be so worried about making mistakes.

I would also be able to learn from my mistakes and move forward, instead of dwelling on them. And who knows, maybe I'll even make some new friends on the team who will support me and help me grow as a player.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>That's a great insight, Austin.

                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>That's a great question, counselor. I think it would take a bit of practice to start reminding myself of those phrases and mantras during the game. Maybe I could write them down and put them on a sticky note on my glove or something, so I can refer to them when I need to. And I think building up my self-compassion muscles would also be important. Maybe I could start by practicing self-compassion in smaller, everyday moments, like when I make a mistake or get frustrated with myself. That way, I can build up my confidence and self-compassion muscles before I try to apply them during the game.</div>
