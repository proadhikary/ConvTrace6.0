                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Hi Pamela, it's nice to meet you. How can I support you today?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I’ve been feeling quite stressed and anxious about always being late when I drive my kids to their sports events. It’s making me feel useless and incompetent.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>I can sense how frustrating and overwhelming that must be for you. Can you tell me more about what's going on when you're driving your kids to their sports events that makes you feel like you're constantly running behind? Is there something specific that's causing the lateness, or is it more of a general feeling of disorganization?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>That's a great question, and I think it's because I'm trying to manage multiple schedules and activities for my kids, and it's just feeling like a lot to keep track of. I also feel like I'm not very organized, and that's causing me to feel more anxious and stressed when I'm trying to get everyone to the right place on time.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're feeling a bit overwhelmed by the complexity of managing multiple schedules and activities for your kids, and that lack of organization is adding to your stress and anxiety. Can you tell me more about what specifically makes you feel like you're not very organized? Is it difficulty with time management, trouble remembering appointments and events, or something else entirely?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think it's a combination of all those things. I have trouble prioritizing, and I often feel like I'm juggling too many things at once. Additionally, I'm not very good at saying no to commitments, so I end up taking on too much, which adds to my stress and anxiety.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're feeling a bit overwhelmed by the sheer volume of responsibilities and commitments you've taken on, and that's making it difficult for you to prioritize and manage your time effectively. Saying no to commitments can be really hard for a lot of people, and it's especially challenging when it comes to things that involve our children. Can you tell me more about what's driving your need to say yes to all of these commitments? Is it a fear of missing out, a desire to be a good parent, or something else?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>That's a great point, and I think it's because I'm afraid that if I say no to something, it means I'm not being a good enough parent or that I'm not prioritizing my children's needs. I also feel like I'm worried about disappointing them or not meeting their expectations.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're carrying a lot of weight on your shoulders, feeling like you're responsible for making sure everything runs smoothly and that your kids are happy and satisfied. It's like you're trying to be a perfect parent, and that's a huge pressure to bear. Can you imagine what it would be like to let go of some of that responsibility and allow yourself to make mistakes or say no to things that don't serve you or your family? How do you think that might feel?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>That's a really interesting perspective, and I can see how I've been putting a lot of pressure on myself to be a perfect parent. I think if I were to let go of that pressure, I might feel more relaxed and less anxious about driving my kids to their sports events. It's like I'm carrying this burden of responsibility, and if I could just release some of that weight, I might be able to enjoy the experience more and not feel so stressed about being late.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're carrying a heavy burden of responsibility as a parent, and that's causing a lot of stress and anxiety for you. It's like you're trying to be a perfect parent, and that's a huge pressure to bear. I want to gently challenge you to consider what would happen if you let go of that perfectionism and allowed yourself to make mistakes or say no to things that don't serve you or your family.</div>

Let's work on some strategies for letting go of that perfectionism and allowing yourself to make mistakes or say no to things that don't serve you or your family. One approach might be to practice self-compassion and remind yourself that it's okay to make mistakes. You could also try setting realistic expectations for yourself and prioritizing your own needs.
