                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Hi Brianna, it's nice to meet you. How are you feeling today?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I'm feeling a bit nervous about this session.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Can you tell me more about what's making you feel nervous? Is it the idea of talking to a therapist, or is there something specific that's bothering you that you'd like to discuss today?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah, I guess I'm just not sure what to expect from this session. I've never been to therapy before, so I'm a bit worried that I'll be judged or that you won't be able to help me with my problems.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>I completely understand your concerns, Brianna. It's natural to feel a bit uncertain when trying something new, especially when it comes to sharing personal struggles with someone you don't know well. I want to assure you that everything we discuss in this session is confidential and a safe space for you to express yourself without fear of judgment. Can you tell me a bit more about what's been going on that's made you feel the need to seek therapy in the first place?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah, I've just been having a tough time with negative thoughts lately. Like, when I'm playing League of Legends with my friends, I always think I'm a bad gamer and that they're just humoring me. It's really affecting my mood and self-esteem.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're experiencing some self-doubt and negative self-talk, especially in situations where you feel like you're being judged or evaluated by others. Can you tell me more about what these negative thoughts are like? What do you say to yourself when you're thinking you're a bad gamer, and how has this been impacting your daily life and relationships outside of gaming?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah, it's like my mind just starts racing with all these negative thoughts, and I can't seem to shake them off. When I'm thinking I'm a bad gamer, I'll say stuff to myself like You're so incompetent, you'll never be good enough or Why do you even bother trying, you're just going to lose anyway. It's like my self-doubt takes over, and I start feeling really anxious and stressed out. It's affecting my daily life because I've started to avoid playing with my friends or joining online games because I don't want to feel like I'm going to fail or make a fool of myself.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like these negative thoughts and self-criticisms are really getting in the way of your enjoyment and confidence in gaming, and also affecting your daily life and relationships. Can you tell me, have you always struggled with self-doubt and negative self-talk, or is this a more recent development for you?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah, I guess it's been going on for a few months now. I used to be really confident in my gaming skills, but lately, I've just been feeling like I'm not good enough. It started after I had a few bad gaming sessions and my friends couldn't play with me, and then I just started to assume that they didn't want to play with me because I'm a bad gamer.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like your self-doubt and negative self-talk have been developing over the past few months, possibly as a result of some setbacks or perceived rejections in your gaming experiences. It's interesting that you mention assuming your friends didn't want to play with you because you're a bad gamer. Can you tell me more about what you think might be driving this assumption, and how you think it might be impacting your relationships with your friends?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah, I think it's just my fear of rejection and failure that's driving these negative thoughts. I've always been worried about not being good enough or being rejected by others, and I think that's just carried over into my gaming experiences. It's hard for me to separate what's really happening from what I'm afraid might happen, so I just assume the worst.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like your fear of rejection and failure is really driving these negative thoughts and assumptions about yourself. Can you tell me more about what you think this fear is rooted in? Is there anything in your past that might have contributed to this fear of not being good enough or being rejected by others?</div>

                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like your fear of rejection and failure has been present for a while, and it's impacting not only your gaming experiences but also your relationships with your friends. Can you tell me more about what you think this fear is rooted in? Is there anything in your past that might have contributed to this fear of not being good enough or being rejected by others?</div>

                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It seems like this fear of rejection and failure has been present for a while, and it's really impacting your life in a significant way. Can you tell me more about what you think might have contributed to the development of this fear? Was there a specific experience or event in your past that might have triggered this fear, or has it always been present for you?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah, I think it's just my fear of rejection and failure that's driving these negative thoughts.

                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like this fear of rejection and failure has been a long-standing issue for you, and it's affecting many areas of your life. I'm curious, have you ever experienced any significant rejections or failures in the past that might have contributed to the development of this fear? Or has it always been present for you?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think it's interesting that I've been assuming my friends don't want to play with me because I'm a bad gamer, but I've never actually talked to them about it. Maybe I'm just jumping to conclusions and not giving them a chance to explain themselves.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're assuming the worst about your friends' intentions without actually having a conversation with them. It's possible that they may have been trying to reach out to you or invite you to play, but you weren't responding or didn't notice their attempts. Have you considered having an open and honest conversation with your friends about your feelings and concerns? How do you think that might help you clarify their intentions and potentially improve your relationships with them?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>That's a good point, I never really thought about it that way. I guess I've just been assuming the worst about my friends without actually talking to them about it. Maybe I'm just jumping to conclusions and not giving them a chance to explain themselves.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It's great that you're considering the possibility that your friends might not be thinking the worst of you. Having open and honest communication with them could really help clarify their intentions and potentially improve your relationships with them. Would you be willing to take the risk and have a conversation with your friends about your feelings and concerns? What do you think might be the outcome of having this conversation, and what are some potential benefits or risks that come with it?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah, I think it could be really helpful to talk to my friends about my feelings and concerns. I've been assuming the worst about them without actually having a conversation, and maybe I'm just jumping to conclusions. Having an open and honest conversation with them could really help me understand their intentions and potentially improve our relationships.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're considering taking a step towards being more open and honest with your friends, which is a great step towards building stronger and more authentic relationships. What do you think might be the most challenging part of having this conversation with your friends, and how do you plan to approach it?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think the most challenging part of having this conversation with my friends would be being vulnerable and open about my feelings and concerns. I've been so used to assuming the worst about them without talking to them about it, that I'm not sure how they'll react if I suddenly start being honest and open. I'm worried that they might think I'm overreacting or that they won't take my feelings seriously.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like being vulnerable and open about your feelings and concerns is a big step for you, and it's natural to feel apprehensive about how your friends might react. Can you tell me more about what you think your friends might be thinking or feeling when you assume they don't want to play with you because you're a bad gamer? What are some possible reactions they might have, and how do you think you could prepare yourself for those reactions?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah, I think you're right, I have been assuming the worst about my friends without actually talking to them about it. I've just been so used to dwelling on negative thoughts and assuming the worst that I haven't stopped to consider the possibility that they might be thinking or feeling something different. Maybe I'm just jumping to conclusions and not giving them a chance to explain themselves. I think having an open and honest conversation with them could really help me understand their intentions and potentially improve our relationships.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're really taking a step towards being more self-aware and willing to challenge your assumptions about your friends. By being more open and honest with them, you might be surprised to find that they're not thinking the worst of you, and that they're actually willing to work with you to improve your gaming skills. What do you think would be a good way to start this conversation with your friends, and what specific things do you want to communicate to them?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think it would be really helpful to talk to my friends about my feelings and concerns in a calm and relaxed environment, maybe over a game or during a casual chat. I want to be honest and open with them about my worries and assumptions, and I also want to give them a chance to explain themselves and share their thoughts and feelings. I'm worried that they might think I'm overreacting or that they won't take my feelings seriously, so I want to approach the conversation in a way that shows that I'm coming from a place of vulnerability and honesty.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're feeling really anxious about having this conversation with your friends, and that's completely normal. It's great that you're willing to take the risk and be open and honest with them. Can you tell me what you think would be a good way to start this conversation with your friends? Would you like to schedule a specific time to talk to them, or do you think it would be better to bring it up in a more casual setting?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think I'm starting to realize that my assumptions about my friends might be based on my own fears and doubts, rather than any actual evidence. It's like I'm expecting them to react in a certain way because of my own anxiety and self-doubt. This conversation with you has really made me think about how I've been approaching my relationships with my friends, and I'm starting to see that I might be putting too much pressure on myself to be perfect.</div>
