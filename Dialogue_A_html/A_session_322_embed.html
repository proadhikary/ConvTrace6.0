                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Hi Evelyn, I'm glad you could make it today. How are you feeling?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I'm just really struggling with managing my expectations. I love reading, but I get so disappointed when I can't finish a book as quickly as I want to.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're putting a lot of pressure on yourself to finish books quickly, and when you don't meet that expectation, it's really frustrating and disappointing. Can you tell me more about what's driving this need to finish books quickly? Is it because you're worried about not having enough time to read in the future, or is it something else entirely?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think it's a combination of things. I like the feeling of accomplishment when I finish a book, and I also feel like it's a way to relax and unwind, but lately, it's been more about keeping up with other readers and comparing myself to them. It's like I'm trying to compete with these people I've never even met, and it's taking the fun out of reading for me.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're experiencing a sense of pressure to keep up with others, which is making your love of reading feel more like a source of stress instead of enjoyment. Can you tell me more about what specifically is bothering you about comparing yourself to these other readers? Is it the feeling that you're not good enough or that you're not doing enough, or is it something else entirely?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah, it's definitely the feeling that I'm not good enough or that I'm not doing enough. I feel like I'm constantly comparing myself to these people who seem to be able to finish books so much faster than me, and it's making me feel like I'm just not cut out for this whole reading thing.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like the comparison to these other readers is really eroding your confidence and self-esteem, making you feel like you're not good enough or capable enough to enjoy reading. Can you think of any times in your life when you've felt this way about something, and how did you handle it back then?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah, I can think of a few times when I felt like I wasn't good enough or capable enough, like when I was in school and I struggled with a particular subject. I would get really frustrated and feel like I was the only one who didn't understand it, but then I would talk to my teachers and they would help me understand the material. It wasn't until I actually got help and support that I realized I wasn't alone in feeling that way.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you've experienced similar feelings of not being good enough or capable enough in the past, and you were able to work through those feelings with the support of your teachers. Can you think of how you might apply that same principle to your current situation with reading? Is there a way you could seek out support or find resources that would help you feel more confident and capable in your reading abilities?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah, I can see how seeking help and support could make a difference. Maybe I could join a book club or find an online community of readers who share my interests, and that way I could connect with others who understand what I'm going through.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're already thinking of ways to seek out support and connect with others who share your passion for reading. Joining a book club or finding an online community could be a great way to do that. Would you be open to exploring some of those options, and would you like to brainstorm some ideas for how to get started?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think it would be really helpful to join a book club or find an online community, because I feel like I'm stuck in this cycle of comparing myself to others and feeling like I'm not good enough. Maybe if I could connect with others who understand what I'm going through, I could start to break free from that cycle and just enjoy reading again.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're really starting to identify some potential solutions to help you break free from this cycle of comparison and self-doubt. Joining a book club or finding an online community could be a great way to connect with others who share your passion for reading and understand what you're going through. Can you think of any specific books or authors that you've been wanting to read, but haven't had the chance to yet? Maybe we could brainstorm some ideas for how to get started with a book club or online community, and what kind of support you might need to take that step.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think that's a great idea, and I'm open to exploring those options. Joining a book club or finding an online community could be a really helpful way to connect with others who share my passion for reading and understand what I'm going through. I've been wanting to read more diverse authors and genres, so maybe we could start by looking into book clubs that focus on diversity and representation.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're really interested in exploring ways to connect with others who share your passion for reading and diverse authors. A book club that focuses on diversity and representation could be a great way to do that. Have you considered what specifically you're looking for in a book club or online community? Is it a sense of belonging, a platform to discuss books with others, or something else entirely?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think I'm looking for a sense of belonging and a platform to discuss books with others. When I read, I feel like I'm missing out on a huge part of the experience because I'm too busy comparing myself to others. I want to be able to connect with people who understand what I'm going through and can help me see reading in a different light.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're really looking for a sense of community and connection with others who share your passion for reading, but also understand the struggles you're experiencing with comparison and self-doubt. You mentioned wanting to read more diverse authors and genres, and a book club that focuses on diversity and representation could be a great way to do that. Would you be open to exploring some online book clubs or forums that focus on diversity and representation, and seeing if any of those might be a good fit for you?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think I'm looking for a sense of belonging and a platform to discuss books with others. When I read, I feel like I'm missing out on a huge part of the experience because I'm too busy comparing myself to others. I want to be able to connect with people who understand what I'm going through and can help me see reading in a different light.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're really clear about what you're looking for in a book club or online community, and that's a sense of belonging and a platform to discuss books with others. You want to connect with people who understand what you're going through and can help you see reading in a different light. I'm wondering, have you considered reaching out to friends or acquaintances who share your passion for reading and seeing if they might be interested in starting a book club or discussion group? Sometimes, building connections with others who share our interests can be a powerful way to feel a sense of belonging and community.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think that's a great idea, and I'm open to exploring those options. But, to be honest, I'm a bit worried that my friends might not understand what I'm going through, or that they might not be interested in reading the same types of books as me. I feel like I'm a bit of an outsider in my social circle when it comes to reading, and I'm not sure if they would be willing to listen to me or support me in the way that I need.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're feeling a bit uncertain about sharing your passions and struggles with your friends, and that's making you hesitant to reach out to them about starting a book club or discussion group. Can you tell me more about what's making you feel like an outsider in your social circle when it comes to reading? Is it because you've noticed that your friends don't share your love of reading, or is it because you feel like you're not good enough or sophisticated enough to discuss books with them?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah, it's definitely the latter. I feel like I'm not good enough or sophisticated enough to discuss books with my friends, because they're always talking about these super complex, literary novels that I've never even heard of, let alone read. I feel like I'm stuck in this rut where I can't keep up with their discussions, and it's making me feel really left out and excluded.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're feeling a sense of inadequacy and exclusion when it comes to discussing books with your friends, and that's making you hesitant to reach out to them about starting a book club or discussion group. It's like you're worried that you won't be able to keep up with their level of literary knowledge or sophistication. Can you think of a time when you felt similarly excluded or left out, and how did you handle it?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah, I can think of a few times when I felt like I wasn't part of the group or that I couldn't keep up with their conversations. Like in school, when I was trying to fit in with the cool kids and they would talk about things that I didn't understand. I would just sit there and listen, feeling like an outsider, and eventually, I realized that I didn't have to fit in with them, and that it was okay to be myself.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you've experienced feelings of exclusion and inadequacy in the past, and it's shaping your current concerns about sharing your passion for reading with your friends. You're worried that you won't be able to keep up with their level of literary knowledge or sophistication, and that's making you feel left out and excluded. But it's interesting that you mentioned realizing that you didn't have to fit in with a certain group to be yourself. Can you think of how you might apply that principle to your current situation? Is there a way you could focus on being true to yourself and your own reading preferences, rather than trying to keep up with others?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think I've been putting too much pressure on myself to fit in with others' reading preferences and expectations. I've been so focused on trying to be like everyone else that I've forgotten why I started reading in the first place, which is to enjoy it and relax. Maybe I need to take a step back and focus on my own reading journey, rather than comparing myself to others.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're recognizing that you've been trying to fit in with others' expectations and preferences, and that's been taking away from your own enjoyment of reading. You're realizing that you don't have to conform to others' standards, and that it's okay to be yourself and have your own reading preferences. Can we explore what that might look like for you? What would it mean to focus on your own reading journey, and how might that help you feel more connected to your love of reading?</div>

But I'm starting to realize that it's okay to take my time and enjoy the process of reading, rather than trying to rush through it. Maybe I need to focus on my own reading journey and what I get out of it, rather than comparing myself to others.</div>
