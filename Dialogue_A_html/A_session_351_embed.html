                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Hello, Courtney. I'm glad you decided to come in today. How are you feeling at the moment?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I'm feeling a bit nervous, but also relieved to be here. Iâ€™ve been struggling with some thoughts lately, and I hope talking about them will help.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Can you tell me more about these thoughts that have been bothering you? What are some of the things that have been going through your mind, and how have they been making you feel?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I've been experiencing a lot of negative self-talk lately, especially when it comes to taking care of my cat. I'll think things like, You're so irresponsible for forgetting to feed your cat, or You're such a failure for not being able to take care of your own pet. These thoughts make me feel really anxious and self-critical, and I often get stuck in a cycle of negative thinking. I've tried setting reminders and routines to help me stay on top of things, but the negative thoughts still persist.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're putting a lot of pressure on yourself to be perfect when it comes to taking care of your cat. Can you help me understand what you think would happen if you didn't meet these high expectations? What's the worst that could happen if you forget to feed your cat or miss a vaccination appointment?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah, I think I'm putting a lot of pressure on myself because I feel like I'm not good enough or capable enough to take care of my cat properly. If I don't meet these expectations, I think the worst that could happen is that my cat might get sick or even die, and that would be all my fault. But I know that's not realistic, and it's just my anxiety talking.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're afraid of being responsible for your cat's well-being, and that's causing you a lot of anxiety. It's understandable to want to ensure your cat's safety and health, but it's also important to recognize that you're not alone in this responsibility. There are many people who take care of multiple pets and still manage to keep them healthy and happy. What do you think would happen if you were to accept that you're doing the best you can, and that it's okay to make mistakes sometimes?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>That's a really good point, and I think I need to work on accepting that I'm doing the best I can. I mean, I'm not perfect, and I'm not going to be perfect, but that doesn't mean I'm a bad person or a bad pet owner. Maybe I just need to focus on the things I can control and let go of the things I can't.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're carrying a heavy burden of responsibility on your shoulders, and that's causing a lot of anxiety for you. It's great that you're recognizing that you're not perfect and that it's okay to make mistakes. Acceptance can be a powerful tool in managing anxiety. Can you tell me more about what it would look like for you to focus on the things you can control and let go of the things you can't? What specific actions or strategies might you use to practice acceptance and reduce your anxiety?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think one thing I could do is to focus on creating a routine for my cat's care that works for me, rather than trying to be perfect. For example, I could set reminders on my phone to ensure I don't forget to feed or medicate my cat. I could also try to break down the tasks into smaller, more manageable chunks, like making a checklist for each day. Additionally, I could remind myself that it's okay to ask for help if I need it, whether it's from my father or brother, or even a professional pet sitter. By shifting my focus to what I can control, I hope to reduce my anxiety and self-criticism.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're already taking some great steps towards managing your anxiety and taking care of your cat. Creating a routine and setting reminders can really help reduce feelings of overwhelm and anxiety. And it's great that you're acknowledging that it's okay to ask for help when you need it. Can you tell me more about what it would look like for you to actually ask for help, and what kind of help you might need? Would you feel comfortable asking your father or brother for assistance, or would you prefer to seek out a professional pet sitter?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think I would feel more comfortable asking my father or brother for help, as we are close and they have experience with pets. They could help me with specific tasks, like taking my cat to the vet or providing additional support with daily care. I could also ask them to hold me accountable and provide reminders to ensure I'm staying on track with my routine.</div>

                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think it's interesting that you brought up the idea of accepting that I'm doing the best I can, and not being too hard on myself when things don't go perfectly. I can see how that could help alleviate some of the anxiety I've been feeling. I also think it's helpful to focus on what I can control, rather than getting bogged down in worries about what might happen if I make a mistake.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're really starting to understand the impact that your negative self-talk is having on your anxiety, and you're beginning to identify some strategies that might help you manage those feelings. Acceptance can be a powerful tool in managing anxiety, and it's great that you're starting to see the value in focusing on what you can control rather than getting caught up in worries about the future. Can you tell me more about what you think would happen if you were to practice more self-compassion and acceptance in your daily life? How might that change your relationship with your cat, and with yourself?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think practicing self-compassion and acceptance would greatly impact my relationship with my cat. I would no longer feel like I'm constantly walking on eggshells, waiting for something to go wrong. I would be able to focus on the present moment and enjoy the time I spend with my cat, rather than being consumed by anxiety and self-doubt. I also think it would improve my overall mental health, as I would be less likely to engage in negative self-talk and more likely to practice self-care and self-compassion.</div>

I also think it's helpful to focus on what I can control, rather than getting bogged down in worries about what might happen if I make a mistake. Maybe I can try to reframe my negative self-talk by asking myself if it's truly helping me or if it's just creating more anxiety. If it's the latter, then maybe I can work on being kinder to myself and focusing on my strengths rather than my weaknesses.</div>
