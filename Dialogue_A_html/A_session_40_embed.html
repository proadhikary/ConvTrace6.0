                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Hello, Christopher. It's nice to meet you. How are you doing today?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I've been feeling really stressed about my job search. It seems like no matter how many applications I send out or interviews I go to, I just can't land a job. It's starting to make me feel hopeless.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>I'm so sorry to hear that you're going through a tough time with your job search. It sounds like it's taking a toll on your emotional well-being. Can you tell me more about what's been going through your mind when you're applying and interviewing? What are some of the thoughts that pop up for you that make you feel hopeless?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah, I've been having a lot of negative thoughts lately. I keep thinking that I'm just not good enough, that there's something wrong with me that's causing me to be unemployed. I also worry that I'll never find a job that I'll be happy with, that I'll be stuck in a dead-end job for the rest of my life. Those thoughts make me feel really anxious and hopeless, and it's hard for me to see a way out of this situation.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're experiencing a lot of self-doubt and fear about your job search. It's common to have negative thoughts when we're facing uncertainty and rejection. Can you help me understand what you mean by I'm just not good enough? What specific things are you comparing yourself to or feeling like you're not measuring up to?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Hmm, I think it's just that I feel like I'm not as qualified or experienced as others who are getting hired. I look at their resumes and I see all these impressive skills and achievements, and I feel like I don't have anything to offer. It's like I'm just not good enough to be considered for these jobs.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're comparing yourself to others and feeling like you don't measure up. Have you noticed any specific instances where you felt like this, or is it more of a general feeling you have about yourself?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah, it's not just a one-time thing; it's a constant feeling I have when I'm applying for jobs. Even when I'm preparing for an interview, I'll see someone else's profile on LinkedIn or their job description, and it'll trigger this feeling of inadequacy. It's like I'm constantly comparing myself to others and feeling like I don't measure up.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like this constant comparison and feeling of inadequacy is really taking a toll on your self-confidence and self-worth. Can you help me understand why you think it's so important to compare yourself to others in this way? Is it because you're trying to prove to yourself or others that you're worthy of a job?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think I'm doing it because I'm trying to show myself and others that I'm capable and deserving of a job. I feel like if I can just prove myself to be good enough, then I'll be able to get hired and be happy. But the problem is, no matter how many times I prove myself, I still feel like I'm not good enough. It's like I'm stuck in this cycle of self-doubt and inadequacy.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like there's a sense of pressure on yourself to constantly prove your worth, and that this pressure is coming from both within and outside of yourself. Can you help me understand what you think would happen if you were to stop comparing yourself to others and just focus on your own strengths and abilities? What would be the outcome for you, and what would that look like in terms of your job search and overall sense of self-worth?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>That's a really good question. I think if I stopped comparing myself to others, I would feel more confident in my own abilities and more focused on what I have to offer. I would stop worrying about what others are doing and start focusing on what I can do to improve my job search. I would also stop beating myself up over my perceived shortcomings and start celebrating my strengths and accomplishments. I think that would help me to feel more positive and hopeful about my job search and my overall sense of self-worth.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you've been carrying around a heavy burden of self-doubt and inadequacy, and it's been affecting your job search and overall well-being. It takes a lot of courage to acknowledge and share these feelings with me, so I want to acknowledge that and thank you for trusting me with this. I also want to let you know that it's not uncommon for people to struggle with self-doubt and comparison, and it's not necessarily a reflection of your worth as a person.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think I'm doing it because I'm trying to show myself and others that I'm capable and deserving of a job.

                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think that's a really crucial step in my job search and overall self-worth. If I can learn to focus on my own strengths and abilities, I'll be able to let go of this constant need to prove myself to others and start feeling more confident in my own skin. It's hard to imagine right now, but I think it would be a huge weight lifted off my shoulders.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're recognizing the importance of shifting your focus from comparing yourself to others to focusing on your own strengths and abilities. Can you help me understand what specific steps you think you might need to take to make this shift, and what kind of support or resources you might need to help you get there?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think focusing on my own strengths and abilities would require me to start tracking my progress, no matter how small, and acknowledging my achievements. I also think I need to work on re-framing my negative thoughts and replacing them with more positive and realistic ones. Maybe we could brainstorm some specific strategies for me to do that.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're already taking some important steps towards recognizing the importance of focusing on your own strengths and abilities. Tracking your progress and acknowledging your achievements can be a powerful way to build confidence and momentum. Reframing your negative thoughts can also be a helpful strategy. Can you tell me more about what you mean by re-framing your negative thoughts? What specifically do you think would be helpful for you to do in terms of replacing those thoughts with more positive and realistic ones?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think reframing my negative thoughts would involve identifying the distorted or unrealistic assumptions behind those thoughts and challenging them with more balanced and optimistic ones. For example, instead of thinking I'm just not good enough, I could try reframing it as I've had a few tough job rejections, but that doesn't define my worth or abilities. Or, instead of thinking I'll never find a job I love, I could try reframing it as I'll continue to explore different job opportunities and focus on finding a role that aligns with my values and strengths. I think this could help me to develop a more realistic and positive perspective on my job search and overall sense of self-worth.</div>
