                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Good morning, Nancy. I'm glad you're here today. To start, could you tell me a bit about what's been going on for you recently?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I've been feeling like I'm not as good of a teacher as my colleagues. Even when students give me positive feedback, I can't shake the feeling that I'm just not measuring up. It's been affecting my confidence a lot, especially in the classroom.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>I can sense how challenging this must be for you, Nancy. It sounds like you're experiencing a bit of self-doubt, even when others are acknowledging your strengths. Can you tell me more about what specifically is making you feel like you're not measuring up? Is it something a colleague said, or is it just a general feeling you've been having?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>It's hard to pinpoint exactly what it is. But I just feel like everyone else is doing a better job than me, and I'm just pretending to be good enough. The feedback from students doesn't really matter, because I always think they're just being nice or don't want to hurt my feelings.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>That sounds really tough, Nancy. It's like you're carrying around this weight of uncertainty and self-doubt, even when others are trying to reassure you. It's interesting that you mention the students' feedback doesn't really matter to you. That makes me wonder, what do you think would need to happen for you to feel more confident in your teaching abilities? Would it take a specific achievement or recognition from colleagues, or is there something else that would make you feel more assured in your role?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I don't know, it's hard to imagine anything that would make me feel confident. I've tried to remind myself of the positive feedback, but it doesn't seem to stick. I guess I just assume that everyone else is better than me and that I'm just fooling myself by thinking I'm good enough.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're struggling to find a way to silence that inner voice of self-doubt, Nancy. It's like you're stuck in a pattern of negative self-talk, where you're constantly comparing yourself to others and assuming you're not good enough. Can we explore this idea of assuming everyone else is better than you? What do you think might be driving that assumption, and is there any evidence to support it?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>It's like, I don't know, maybe I just am not good enough. Maybe I'm just fooling myself by thinking I can be a good teacher. I don't know how to make myself believe otherwise.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Nancy, it sounds like you're really stuck in this cycle of self-doubt and negative self-talk. It's like you're searching for evidence to support your assumption that you're not good enough, and you're finding it hard to find any counter-evidence to challenge that assumption. Can we try to reframe this assumption for a moment? What would happen if, instead of assuming you're not good enough, you assumed that you're capable of learning and growth, just like your students? Would that change the way you approach your teaching and your self-evaluation?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>It sounds like you're suggesting that I'm being too hard on myself, but it feels like that's just reality. I mean, I'm not getting the same recognition as my colleagues, so it's hard to believe that I'm as good as they are. And even if I tried to assume that I'm capable of learning and growth, it wouldn't change the fact that I'm not getting the same results as them.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>I can understand why it feels that way, Nancy. It's like you're trying to reconcile the discrepancy between your internal experience and the external reality. You're saying, Hey, I may be capable of learning and growth, but what about the lack of recognition and the perceived gap in performance with my colleagues? That's a really valid concern. Can we explore this idea of recognition and what it means to you? What do you think would happen if you started to focus more on your own growth and development, rather than comparing yourself to others? Would that change the way you experience your teaching and your sense of self-efficacy?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>It's hard for me to focus on my own growth and development when I'm constantly being compared to others. It feels like I'm always being measured against this arbitrary standard, and I just can't seem to meet it. Even if I were to focus on my own growth, I'm not sure I'd be able to shake off the feeling that I'm not good enough. It's just so deeply ingrained in me.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like the sense of not being good enough is deeply entrenched and connected to your sense of identity as a teacher. It's not just about recognizing your own growth and development, but also about the perceived gap in performance with your colleagues. You're saying that even if you were to focus on your own growth, you're not sure you'd be able to shake off the feeling that you're not good enough. That's a really important point. Can we explore this idea of identity and how it's tied to your sense of self-worth as a teacher? What do you think would happen if you were able to separate your sense of identity from your performance, and focus more on your own values and principles as an educator?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>It feels like I've been living in this constant state of self-doubt, always questioning my abilities and my worth as a teacher. It's like I'm forever stuck in this cycle of negative self-talk, and I don't know how to break free from it.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're carrying a heavy burden of self-doubt, Nancy. It's like you're trapped in a pattern of negative self-talk, constantly comparing yourself to others and assuming you're not good enough. I want you to know that it's understandable to feel this way, but it's also important to recognize that it might be limiting your growth and development as a teacher.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>It's hard for me to imagine a scenario where I wouldn't be comparing myself to others, because it's just so ingrained in my teaching practice. I think that's what makes it so hard for me to focus on my own growth and development - I feel like I'm constantly being measured against someone else's standards.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're struggling to separate your sense of identity as a teacher from your performance, and that's making it hard for you to focus on your own growth and development. I'd like to propose an exercise to help you explore this further. Imagine you're standing in front of a whiteboard, and on that whiteboard, you're going to write down all the values and principles that are important to you as an educator. What are those things that drive you, that make you feel fulfilled, and that you stand for? It might be things like creating a supportive learning environment, helping students overcome challenges, or making a positive impact on their lives. Once you have that list, I'd like you to reflect on how those values and principles might be in conflict with your current pattern of self-doubt and comparison. How might acknowledging and honoring those values help you shift your perspective and focus on your own growth and development?</div>
