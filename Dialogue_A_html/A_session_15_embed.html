                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Hello Jessica, welcome to our session today. How are you feeling?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I'm feeling overwhelmed. It seems like no matter what I do, I can't shake the feeling that my bipolar disorder is holding me back at work.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>I can sense how challenging it must be for you to feel like your bipolar disorder is impacting your work. Can you tell me more about what specifically is feeling overwhelming to you? Is it a particular task, a project, or more of a general feeling of being stuck?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I guess it's just everything. I feel like I'm constantly struggling to keep up with my work and family responsibilities. And on top of that, I have these negative thoughts that I'm just not good enough as a nurse because of my bipolar disorder. It's like, no matter what I do, I'll always be held back by my condition.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're feeling like you're carrying a heavy burden, and it's affecting not just your work but also your relationships with your family. Those negative thoughts can be really debilitating. Can you help me understand, what kind of negative thoughts are you having about yourself as a nurse, and how are you trying to cope with those feelings?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I don't know, it's just that I feel like I'm constantly struggling to keep up with everything, and it's always on my mind. I'm always worried that I'm going to fail or that my patients are going to suffer because of my bipolar disorder. It's like, I'm constantly walking on eggshells, wondering when the other shoe is going to drop. And even when things are going well, I'm always waiting for the other shoe to drop.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're experiencing a lot of anxiety and uncertainty about your ability to perform as a nurse, and that's really taking a toll on your mental health. It's understandable that you're worried about failing or impacting your patients. Can you tell me more about what it means to you to 'keep up' with everything? Is there a specific level of performance or expectation that you're trying to meet, or is it more about feeling like you're managing your responsibilities?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah, it's like I'm always trying to meet this unattainable standard, and when I don't, I feel like a complete failure. And it's not just about my job performance; it's also about being a good mother and wife. I feel like I'm constantly letting people down, and that's a really heavy burden to carry.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're putting a lot of pressure on yourself to meet this unattainable standard, and when you don't, you feel like you're a complete failure. It's like you're carrying this weight of responsibility and accountability for everyone's happiness. Can you help me understand, where did you learn to take on this level of responsibility? Was it from your upbringing, or is it something that's developed over time?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah, it's like I've always been a perfectionist, even as a child. I remember my parents always pushing me to be the best, and I thought that's what it meant to be a good person. And then, as I got older, I started to realize that nobody's perfect, but I still felt like I had to be. I guess it's just carried over into my adult life, and now it's affecting my relationships and my job performance.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you've been carrying this expectation of perfectionism for a long time, and it's been a driving force in your life. It's not uncommon for people to develop these high standards as a way to cope with the pressure to be good enough, especially if they've had parents or caregivers who emphasized achievement. Can you help me understand how this expectation of perfectionism is impacting your self-care and self-compassion? Are there any moments where you're able to be kind to yourself, or do you tend to be quite hard on yourself when you don't meet your own standards?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>It's like, I'm so used to being hard on myself that I don't even realize I'm doing it anymore. I think it's just become a automatic reaction. Sometimes I'll have a good day at work and think, Oh, this is great, I'm finally doing okay. But then something will go wrong, and it's like, No, I'm still a failure. It's like, I'm always waiting for the other shoe to drop, you know? And even when things are going well, I'm still worried about what's going to happen next.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're so used to being critical of yourself that it's become a habitual way of thinking. It's almost like you're waiting for the other shoe to drop, and that can be really exhausting. I want to encourage you to take a step back and notice when you're being hard on yourself. Can you try to catch yourself when you're having those negative thoughts and replace them with something kinder? Maybe something like, 'I did my best, and that's good enough.' What do you think? Is that something you're willing to try?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I'm not sure, it's hard for me to accept that I'm doing my best is good enough. It sounds so... weak. I mean, I want to be perfect, I want to be the best nurse I can be.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Ah, I hear that it's really tough for you to accept that 'good enough' might be okay. It's like you're still holding onto this idea that perfection is the only standard that matters. Can you help me understand why you think it sounds 'weak' to accept that you're doing your best? Is it because you're worried that others will think less of you or that you'll lose your sense of identity as a perfectionist?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think it's because I've always associated being perfect with being strong and capable. If I'm not perfect, then I'm vulnerable and weak. It's like, if I'm not the best nurse, then I'm not a good nurse. I don't know, it's hard for me to wrap my head around the idea that being good enough is okay. It feels like I'm giving up or settling for mediocrity.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're tied to this idea that being perfect is the only way to demonstrate strength and capability. It's understandable that you're struggling to let go of that because it's been a part of your identity for a long time. But I want to gently challenge that idea. Being good enough doesn't mean you're settling or giving up; it means you're acknowledging that you're human and that it's okay to make mistakes. It's a sign of strength to be able to admit when you're not perfect and to be kind to yourself in the process. Can you start to explore the idea that being good enough is not the same as being weak or mediocre?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I'm not sure. I feel like I've been living my whole life according to this expectation of perfection, and it's hard for me to imagine that I can be good enough. It's like, what's the point of trying if I'm not going to be the best? I guess I need to think about what's more important to me - being perfect or being happy.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're caught in a cycle of self-criticism and perfectionism, and it's affecting your mental health and relationships. I want to gently challenge the idea that being perfect is the only way to be happy and fulfilled. Being good enough doesn't mean you're settling or giving up; it means you're acknowledging that you're human and that it's okay to make mistakes. It's a sign of strength to be able to admit when you're not perfect and to be kind to yourself in the process. Can you start to explore the idea that being good enough is not the same as being weak or mediocre?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think I've been so focused on being perfect that I forgot what it's like to be happy. I've been so caught up in trying to meet everyone's expectations that I haven't stopped to think about what I want for myself. Maybe being good enough is okay, and it's time for me to start focusing on my own happiness instead of trying to be perfect all the time.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you've been carrying this heavy burden of perfectionism for a long time, and it's been affecting not just your work but also your relationships and overall well-being. I want to acknowledge that it takes a lot of courage to be willing to challenge these expectations and consider a different path forward. It's like you're starting to awaken to the possibility that being good enough might be okay, and that's a really important realization. Can you help me understand what it would mean for you to prioritize your own happiness and well-being, rather than trying to meet everyone else's expectations? What would that look like for you, and what are some small steps you could take to start moving in that direction?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think what would be important for me to prioritize my own happiness and well-being is to start setting realistic goals for myself and celebrating small victories along the way. Instead of focusing on being perfect, I could focus on being good enough and acknowledging that it's okay to make mistakes. I'd also like to work on being kinder to myself and practicing self-compassion. I feel like if I can learn to be more gentle with myself, I'll be able to reduce my anxiety and stress levels and be more present in my daily life.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Can you help me understand what kind of small steps you could take to start prioritizing your own happiness and well-being, rather than trying to meet everyone else's expectations? For example, what are some things you could do to celebrate small victories and practice self-compassion?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think one small step I could take is to start keeping a daily journal where I write down three things I'm grateful for each day. This way, I can focus on the positive aspects of my life and acknowledge that I'm doing my best, even if I'm not perfect. I could also start practicing mindfulness meditation to help me stay present in the moment and reduce my anxiety. And, I could set aside time each week to do something I enjoy, like reading or taking a walk, so I can prioritize my own happiness and well-being.</div>

It's like, finally, I'm acknowledging that I'm not perfect and that it's okay to make mistakes. I'm realizing that I've been living my life according to someone else's expectations, and that's not healthy. I want to start focusing on what makes me happy and fulfilled, rather than trying to meet everyone else's expectations. I think this is going to take some time to get used to, but I'm willing to try.</div>
