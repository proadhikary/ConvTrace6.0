                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Hello Edward, it's nice to meet you. What brings you to counseling today?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Honestly, it's just that every time I tell someone I'm an accountant, I can see their eyes glaze over. It's like they're already bored before I even get a chance to say anything else.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're feeling like you're being reduced to just your job title, and that people aren't seeing you as a person with interests and qualities beyond that. Can you tell me more about what that's like for you? How does it make you feel when you see people's eyes glaze over?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah, it's just so frustrating. I feel like I'm being defined by this one aspect of my life, and it's like I'm just a stereotype or something. It makes me feel like I'm not good enough, like I'm not interesting or worthy of attention.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're feeling a sense of invisibility and lack of validation, like you're not being seen or heard as a complex person. Can you help me understand what you think is behind this feeling of not being good enough? Is it something that's been going on for a while, or is it more recent?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I don't know, it just feels like it's always been there, even before I became an accountant. I think it's because society has this expectation that accountants are supposed to be boring and uninteresting, and I feel like I'm living up to that stereotype whether I like it or not.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're feeling trapped by societal expectations and stereotypes, and that's making you feel like you're not living up to your own potential or being seen as the person you are. Can you tell me more about what you think it would take to break free from this expectation and be seen as more than just an accountant?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah, it's hard for me to even imagine that because I feel like I'm so deeply ingrained in this stereotype that I don't know who I would be without it. It's like I'm stuck in this role, and I don't know how to get out of it.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're feeling a strong sense of identification with the stereotype of an accountant being boring, and that's making it hard for you to imagine being seen as anything else. It's like you're stuck in this role and don't know how to break free. Can you tell me more about what you think would happen if you were to let go of this stereotype and start to explore other aspects of yourself? What do you think you might discover about yourself if you weren't defined solely by your job title?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>It's hard for me to even think about that because I feel like I've already given up on the idea of being interesting or worthy of attention. I've just accepted that I'm going to be boring and uninteresting, and that's just who I am as a person.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you've been carrying this sense of being uninteresting and boring for a long time, and it's become a deeply ingrained part of your self-image. It's like you've given up on the idea of being seen as more than just an accountant. Can you help me understand what you think would happen if you were to challenge this self-image and start to explore other aspects of yourself? What do you think would happen if you were to start to see yourself as more than just your job title?</div>

                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're struggling with a deep sense of self-doubt and feelings of being trapped by societal expectations and stereotypes. It's like you've given up on the idea of being seen as more than just an accountant and have accepted that you're just going to be boring and uninteresting. Can we explore what might happen if you were to challenge this self-image and start to explore other aspects of yourself? What do you think would happen if you were to start to see yourself as more than just your job title?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I feel like the more I try to think about who I am beyond being an accountant, the more overwhelmed I get. It's like my mind is stuck in this one role and I don't know how to shake it off. I've always defined myself by my job, and it's hard for me to imagine being anything else.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're feeling stuck in this one role and it's hard for you to imagine being anything else. It's like your sense of identity is deeply tied to being an accountant, and it's making it hard for you to think about who you are beyond that. Can we explore some strategies to help you break free from this identification with your job title? For example, what are some things you enjoy doing in your free time? Are there any hobbies or activities that bring you joy and help you feel more fulfilled?</div>

It's like your sense of identity is deeply tied to this one role, and it's making it hard for you to think about who you are beyond that. Can we explore some strategies to help you begin to untangle this identification and discover more about yourself? For example, let's start with small steps, like taking a few minutes each day to think about what you enjoy doing in your free time, or what brings you joy and fulfillment. What do you think might be some small steps you could take to start to explore who you are beyond being an accountant?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I'm not sure what you're getting at, but it feels like you're trying to make me feel guilty for being an accountant or something. I just don't see how I can be anything else, it's who I am.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It doesn't feel like I'm trying to make you feel guilty for being an accountant. It sounds like you're feeling a sense of stuckness and uncertainty about how to break free from this identification with being an accountant. I'm actually trying to help you explore ways to untangle this identification and discover more about yourself. Can we take a step back and focus on what you enjoy doing in your free time? What are some things that bring you joy and fulfillment that have nothing to do with your job as an accountant?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I don't see how I can be anything else, it's who I am.</div>
