                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Hi Nancy, I'm glad you're here today. How are you feeling about this session?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I'm feeling a mix of nervousness and hope. I really want to address this self-doubt I've been experiencing.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>That sounds like a really tough place to be, Nancy. It takes a lot of courage to acknowledge and want to work on those feelings. Can you tell me more about what's been going on that's making you feel so uncertain and doubtful about yourself?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think it started about a year ago when our school administration introduced these new standards for teaching and evaluation. It created a very competitive environment among teachers. I've always been someone who strives for excellence, but this constant comparison to my colleagues has been weighing heavily on me. I feel like I'm constantly falling short, and it's affecting my confidence in the classroom.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>I can sense how stressful and overwhelming that must be for you. It sounds like the competitive environment has really taken a toll on your self-perception and confidence. Can you tell me more about what specifically is making you feel like you're falling short? Is it the evaluations, the feedback you're receiving, or something else entirely?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think it's a combination of everything. The evaluations and feedback are always a challenge, but I also feel like my colleagues are always one step ahead of me in terms of lesson planning and classroom management. It's like I'm constantly playing catch-up, and it's hard to keep up the facade of being a confident teacher when I'm feeling so uncertain and insecure.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're feeling like you're stuck in a cycle of self-doubt and comparison, and it's affecting your ability to be your authentic self in the classroom. Can you tell me more about what you mean by 'the facade of being a confident teacher'? What does that look like for you, and how do you think it's impacting your relationships with your students and colleagues?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>That's a great question, and I think it's really important to acknowledge that I'm not always being my authentic self in the classroom. Sometimes I feel like I'm putting on a mask to appear confident and competent, but inside, I'm still struggling with self-doubt. This facade is affecting my relationships with my students and colleagues because I'm not being able to connect with them on a deeper level. I'm always worried about what others think of me, and that's making it hard for me to build trust and rapport with them.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like carrying this facade of confidence is taking a lot of energy and emotional labor from you, Nancy. It's like you're trying to be someone you're not, and that must be exhausting. Can you imagine what it would be like to let go of that mask and just be yourself, flaws and all, in the classroom? What do you think would change for you and your relationships with your students and colleagues if you could show up as your authentic self?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>That's a really powerful question, and I think it's something I've been wanting to explore for a long time. If I could let go of this mask and just be myself in the classroom, I think it would be incredibly liberating. I wouldn't have to worry so much about what others think of me, and I could focus on building genuine connections with my students and colleagues. I think that would lead to a more authentic and meaningful teaching experience for everyone involved.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're carrying a heavy burden of self-doubt and the pressure to present a confident exterior, which is taking a toll on your relationships and overall well-being. I want to acknowledge that it's incredibly brave to acknowledge this and want to make changes. Can we explore what steps you might take to start letting go of this mask and being more authentic in the classroom? What small changes do you think you could make to start showing up as yourself, flaws and all?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think one small step I could take is to start being more transparent with my students about my struggles and doubts. I could share with them that I'm a work-in-progress, just like they are, and that it's okay to make mistakes. By doing so, I might be able to build more trust and rapport with them, and they might feel more comfortable being themselves in the classroom as well.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>That's a wonderful idea, Nancy. Being more transparent with your students about your struggles and doubts could be a powerful way to build trust and connection with them. It's also a great step towards being more authentic and showing up as yourself in the classroom. Can you imagine how you might feel if you were to share this with your students, and what kind of reaction you might get? Additionally, what do you think would be the most challenging part of being more transparent with your students, and how might you prepare yourself for that?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think the most challenging part of being more transparent with my students would be letting go of the fear of being perceived as weak or vulnerable. As a teacher, I'm used to being seen as a authority figure, and I worry that if I show my doubts and struggles, my students might not respect me as much. However, I also believe that being honest and authentic with my students could be a powerful way to build trust and connection with them. If I can overcome my fear and be more vulnerable, I think it could lead to a more positive and supportive learning environment.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're really tuning in to your values and what's important to you, Nancy. You're recognizing that being authentic and vulnerable with your students could be a powerful way to build trust and connection with them. I'm curious, what do you think would happen if you were to share your doubts and struggles with your students, and then your students were to respond with criticism or disrespect? How would you handle that situation, and what do you think would be the most important thing for you to keep in mind in that moment?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>That's a great question, and I think it's really important to acknowledge that I'm not always being my authentic self in the classroom. Sometimes I feel like I'm putting on a mask to appear confident and competent, but inside, I'm still struggling with self-doubt. This facade is affecting my relationships with my students and colleagues because I'm not being able to connect with them on a deeper level. I'm always worried about what others think of me, and that's making it hard for me to build trust and rapport with them.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're really leaning into your fears and worries about being perceived as weak or vulnerable if you share your doubts and struggles with your students. That takes a lot of courage. I want to acknowledge that it's okay to have those fears, but also to encourage you to consider what might happen if you don't share your truth with your students. Are you worried that if you don't present a perfect exterior, your students will lose respect for you or not take you seriously as a teacher? And if so, what do you think would happen if you were to challenge that assumption and take a risk by being more authentic with your students?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think that's a really important point, and it's something I've been struggling with a lot lately. I've been trying to present this perfect exterior, but inside, I'm still struggling with self-doubt and uncertainty. If I were to challenge that assumption and take a risk by being more authentic with my students, I think it would be incredibly liberating. I wouldn't have to worry so much about what others think of me, and I could focus on building genuine connections with my students.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're really close to tapping into the power of being authentic and vulnerable with your students. You're recognizing that presenting a perfect exterior is exhausting and that being yourself, flaws and all, could be a powerful way to build trust and connection with your students. I want to encourage you to keep exploring this idea and to consider what small steps you could take to start showing up as yourself in the classroom. What do you think would happen if you were to start sharing your doubts and struggles with your students, but not as a way to seek validation or sympathy, but rather as a way to connect with them on a deeper level and build trust?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think that's a really powerful question, and I'm starting to see how being more authentic with my students could be a way to build trust and connection with them, rather than trying to present a perfect exterior. I've been so focused on trying to be someone I'm not, and it's exhausting. If I could start being more vulnerable and genuine with my students, I think it could lead to a more positive and supportive learning environment. I'm excited to explore this idea further and see what small steps I could take to start showing up as myself in the classroom.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're really getting in touch with the costs of trying to present a perfect exterior, Nancy. It's exhausting and affecting your relationships with your students and colleagues. I want to acknowledge that it takes a lot of courage to recognize this and want to make changes. Can we explore what it might mean for you to start letting go of the need for perfection and instead focus on being authentic and vulnerable with your students? What do you think would happen if you were to start sharing your doubts and struggles with your students, not to seek validation or sympathy, but rather as a way to connect with them on a deeper level and build trust?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think it's interesting that you keep referring to it as letting go of the need for perfection. It feels like I've been trying to hold onto this notion of perfection for so long that it's become a part of my identity. I'm not sure what it would mean to let go of that, but I'm willing to explore it further. Maybe it would mean starting to focus on being authentic and vulnerable with my students, rather than trying to present this perfect exterior. I'm not sure what that would look like, but I'm open to finding out.</div>

                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think it would be helpful to start by having a conversation with one of my students, maybe one who I feel a connection with, and just be honest with them about my struggles and doubts. I could start by sharing a specific experience where I felt uncertain or doubtful, and then ask them how they would handle it. I think this could be a way to build trust and connection with them, and also help me feel more comfortable being vulnerable.</div>
