                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Hello, Andrew. I'm glad you decided to come in today. How are you feeling right now?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I'm feeling a bit overwhelmed lately. It's like no matter how much I try to improve, the self-doubt just keeps creeping in.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Can you tell me more about what's been going on that's making you feel overwhelmed? Is it specific situations or events, or more of an overall feeling you're carrying around?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah, it's been a combination of both, I think. Sometimes it's specific situations, like when I get negative feedback from a competition or a customer at work, and other times it's just this general feeling of inadequacy that follows me around. It's like I'm constantly waiting for the other shoe to drop, you know?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're carrying around a lot of anxiety and self-doubt, and it's affecting your daily life. Can you tell me more about what happens when you get negative feedback from a competition or a customer at work? How does that make you feel, and what do you usually do after that?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah, it's a really tough feeling to shake off. When I get negative feedback, I feel like I'm a total failure, like all my hard work was for nothing. I start replaying the situation in my head, wondering what I could've done differently, and I just get stuck on that. Sometimes I'll try to rationalize it, telling myself it's not a big deal, but deep down, I'm still convinced that I'm not good enough. After that, I usually just want to hide and avoid any more negative feedback or criticism. It's like I'm trying to protect myself from getting hurt again.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like negative feedback can really trigger a lot of negative self-talk and self-doubt for you. It's like your mind starts playing scenarios over and over again, replaying what could've been done differently. Can you tell me more about this feeling of being a total failure that comes up when you get negative feedback? What does that feel like in your body? Is it like a specific sensation or emotion?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah, it's a really heavy, sinking feeling in my stomach. It's like my whole body is weighted down with this sense of inadequacy. It's hard to describe, but it's almost like my self-confidence just gets sucked out of me, leaving me feeling empty and uncertain.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like that feeling of being a total failure is deeply embodied for you, and it's affecting your whole being. That heavy, sinking feeling in your stomach is really intense. Can you stay with that feeling for a moment, and see if you can notice any other physical sensations that arise in your body when you're experiencing that sense of inadequacy?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah, it's like my chest feels tight and constricted, like I'm taking a deep breath, but it's not really getting in. And sometimes I get this weird tingling sensation in my fingers, like I'm trying to grasp something, but I'm not really sure what. It's like my body is trying to hold onto something, but I'm not sure what that is.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like your body is holding a lot of tension and anxiety when you're experiencing feelings of inadequacy. The heavy, sinking feeling in your stomach, tightness in your chest, and tingling in your fingers are all physical sensations that are closely tied to your emotional experience. Can you explore with me what you think might be causing this physical tension? Is it like your body is trying to prepare for action, or is it more like it's trying to protect yourself from something?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah, I think it's a mix of both. Sometimes I feel like my body is preparing for action, like I'm getting ready to fight or run away from this feeling of inadequacy. But other times, I feel like my body is just trying to protect me from getting hurt again. It's like I'm in this constant state of hypervigilance, waiting for the other shoe to drop.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like your body is experiencing a lot of anxiety and tension when you're feeling inadequate, and that's really understandable. It's like your body is in a state of constant readiness, preparing for either fight or flight. Can you explore with me what you think might happen if you were to let go of some of this physical tension and just allow yourself to feel this sense of inadequacy without trying to avoid it or push it away? What do you think might happen if you were to just sit with it and observe it, without trying to change or control it?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>That's a tough question, to be honest. I think if I let go of this physical tension and allowed myself to feel this sense of inadequacy without trying to avoid it or push it away, I might feel even more overwhelmed and anxious. It's like I'm trying to protect myself from this feeling, and if I let my guard down, I'm not sure what might happen. But at the same time, I've been trying to avoid this feeling for so long, and it's only made it worse. Maybe if I could just sit with it and observe it, I could start to understand it better and maybe even find a way to move forward.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It takes a lot of courage to explore these feelings of inadequacy and anxiety, and I appreciate your willingness to do so. It's interesting that you're wondering what might happen if you were to let go of some of this physical tension and just allow yourself to feel this sense of inadequacy without trying to avoid it or push it away. Can you tell me more about what you mean by understanding it better and finding a way to move forward? What do you think you might learn about yourself or gain from this process?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think if I could understand this sense of inadequacy better, I might be able to see that it's not as overwhelming as I think it is. Maybe I'm not a complete failure, and there are things I can do to improve. I'm not sure, but I feel like if I could just sit with this feeling and explore it, I might be able to find a way to move forward and not let it hold me back from pursuing my dreams.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're carrying around a lot of anxiety and self-doubt, and it's affecting your daily life. You mentioned that when you get negative feedback, you feel like you're a total failure, and that feeling of inadequacy can be really overwhelming. You described physical sensations in your body, like a heavy, sinking feeling in your stomach, tightness in your chest, and tingling in your fingers, which are closely tied to your emotional experience. It's like your body is holding a lot of tension and anxiety when you're experiencing feelings of inadequacy.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think I'm starting to realize that this sense of inadequacy is not just about the negative feedback or criticism I receive, but it's also about my own expectations and standards that I set for myself. It's like I'm my own worst critic, always looking for things to improve and never satisfied with my performance.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're saying that you're not only affected by external feedback, but also by your own internal expectations and standards. It's like you're constantly pushing yourself to be better, and that can be really exhausting. Can you tell me more about what drives these high expectations for yourself? Is it a sense of responsibility, a desire to prove yourself to others, or something else entirely?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah, I think it's a mix of all those things. I've always been a perfectionist, and I think that's partly due to my mom passing away when I was a kid. I felt like I had to be perfect to make up for her absence, to make her proud. And now, as a chef, I feel like I have to be perfect to prove myself to my customers and colleagues. It's like I'm constantly trying to live up to these expectations, and when I don't meet them, I feel like a failure.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Can you explore with me the idea that these high expectations for yourself might be rooted in a sense of responsibility to make up for your mom's passing, and that it's affecting your current life as a chef? How do you think this might be impacting your relationships with your customers and colleagues, and is there a way to reframe this sense of responsibility so that it's not quite so heavy or overwhelming?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah, I think that makes sense. I never really thought about how my childhood experiences might be affecting me now, but it makes sense that my desire to be perfect is rooted in that sense of responsibility to make up for my mom's passing. It's like I'm still trying to prove myself to her, even though she's not here. And I can see how that's affecting my relationships with my customers and colleagues, too. I'm always trying to be perfect and please everyone, and that can be really exhausting.</div>
