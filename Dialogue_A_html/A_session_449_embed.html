                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Hello, Nick. I'm glad you're here today. How are you feeling?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I've been feeling really isolated and it's hard to shake off this label of being a geek just because I'm good at science. It's like no matter what I do, that's all people see.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>I can sense how frustrating and painful that must be for you. It sounds like you're struggling with feeling trapped in this one aspect of yourself and it's affecting your overall sense of identity and connection with others. Can you tell me more about what specifically happens when you feel like people are reducing you to just being a geek? What are some of the situations or interactions that trigger these feelings for you?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>It's like, I don't know, it's just everywhere. Even my own parents sometimes make jokes about how I'm a science nerd and it's like, yeah, I get it, I'm good at science, but can't they see that there's more to me than just that? And it's not just my parents, it's my teachers, my classmates, even my friends. They all just assume that because I'm good at science, I'm some kind of freak or outcast.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're feeling like you're not being seen or acknowledged as a complex person with multiple dimensions. It's like people are reducing you to this one aspect of yourself, and that's just not who you are. Can you tell me more about what you wish people would see or acknowledge about you, besides just being good at science? What are some of your hobbies, interests, or values that you feel are being overlooked?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah, I guess I just wish people could see me as more than just a science nerd. I mean, I love science, it's something that I'm really passionate about, but it's not the only thing that defines me. I like playing guitar, watching movies, and hanging out with my friends. But no one ever seems to care about those things. They're always like, Oh, you're so smart in science class, and it's like, yeah, I get good grades, but that's not the only thing that matters. I feel like people are just so focused on this one aspect of me that they're missing out on the rest of who I am.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're yearning for a more balanced and multifaceted understanding of yourself. You're craving connection and recognition for who you are as a person, not just your academic achievements. It's beautiful that you have hobbies and interests outside of science, and it's important to remember that those are a big part of what makes you, you. Can you tell me more about what it would mean to you if people were to acknowledge and value those aspects of your personality? How do you think that would impact your sense of identity and feeling connected to others?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah, I guess it would mean a lot to me if people could see me as more than just a science nerd. If they could recognize that I'm a person with thoughts, feelings, and experiences beyond just being good at science, it would be a huge relief. It would make me feel more seen and heard, and less like I'm just a label or a stereotype. And I think it would also help me build stronger connections with others, because I wouldn't feel like I'm hiding behind this one aspect of myself.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like acknowledgment and validation of your non-academic interests and aspects of your personality could have a profound impact on your sense of identity and connection with others. It's almost like you're yearning for a sense of wholeness and authenticity in your relationships. Can you imagine what that would look like, if you had relationships where you felt like you could be your full self, without being reduced to just one label or aspect of yourself?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>It's hard for me to imagine, because I feel like I've been living in this label of being a geek for so long that it's hard to see myself outside of it. But I think if I could have those kinds of relationships, it would be amazing. I would feel like I'm not alone in feeling this way, and that people understand me on a deeper level. It would be a huge relief to know that I don't have to hide who I am or what I'm interested in.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're carrying a heavy burden of feeling like you're stuck in this one label, and it's affecting your sense of identity and connection with others. I want to acknowledge that it takes a lot of courage to share your desires and longings with me, and I'm here to listen and support you. Can you imagine what it would be like to have a friend or family member who genuinely cares about who you are as a person, and not just your academic achievements? Someone who would ask you about your hobbies, your favorite movies, or your thoughts and feelings, and truly listen to your responses?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I guess it's hard for me to imagine that someone would care about all those things about me, because I've never really had that kind of relationship before. I mean, my parents are always talking about my grades and my science projects, and my friends are always like, Hey, nice job on that science test! But no one ever asks me what I'm really interested in or what I'm passionate about outside of science. It's like they're only interested in the label of being a geek and not who I am as a person.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're carrying a lot of pain and frustration from feeling like you're not being seen or acknowledged as a complex person. It's like people are only interested in the surface-level aspect of you, and not the deeper, more vulnerable parts of yourself. Can you imagine what it would be like to have a relationship where you feel safe to be vulnerable and share your true self with someone? Someone who would listen with empathy and understanding, and not just try to categorize you or reduce you to a label?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I don't know, it's just really hard for me to see myself outside of this label of being a geek. I've been living with it for so long that I feel like it's a part of who I am. But at the same time, I wish people could see me as more than just that. I wish they could see my passions, my interests, my values, and my fears. I wish they could see the real me, not just the label that I've been given.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're struggling to imagine a life outside of this label, but at the same time, you're yearning for someone to see you as more than just that. It's like you're stuck in this cycle of feeling like you're not being seen or acknowledged as a complex person. Can you imagine what it would be like to have a mirror held up to you that reflects all of who you are, not just one aspect of yourself? Someone who would see you as a multifaceted person with strengths, weaknesses, passions, and fears?</div>

                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Can you tell me more about what you think would happen if people were to see you as more than just a geek? Would you feel like you'd be able to relax and be yourself around them, or would you still be worried about being judged or labeled?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think if people were to see me as more than just a geek, I would feel like I could finally breathe a sigh of relief. I would feel like I'm not trapped in this one label and that I can finally be myself without fear of judgment. But at the same time, I'm not sure if I would be able to fully relax and be myself, because I've been living with this label for so long that it's hard for me to imagine being seen as anything else.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're carrying a lot of uncertainty and self-doubt about what it would mean to be seen as more than just a geek. You're worried that people might still judge you or see you as weird, even if they acknowledge your non-academic interests. Can you imagine what it would be like to have a relationship where you feel like you can be yourself, without fear of judgment or labeling?
