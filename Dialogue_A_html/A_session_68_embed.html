                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Hi Barbara, welcome. How are you feeling today?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think I'm mostly feeling overwhelmed. These thoughts have been with me for so long that I don't even know where to start.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're feeling a bit stuck and unsure of how to move forward. Can you tell me a bit more about these thoughts that have been with you for so long? What are some of the things that come to mind when you think about them, and how have they been affecting you?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah, it's just this feeling that my parents didn't really want me, that I was an accident or something. And it's hard for me to shake that feeling, even when I try to be rational about it. It's like, I know my parents love me, but that thought just keeps popping up and making me feel so alone and unloved.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like this thought has been a recurring theme for you, and it's causing you a lot of distress. Can you help me understand what's driving this thought, do you think it's related to something specific that happened in your childhood or is it more of a general feeling that's been building over time?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think it's a combination of both. Growing up without siblings and feeling like I was always the center of attention, even though my parents loved me, might have played a role in this feeling of not being wanted. And maybe it's also the fact that my parents never really talked about having more children, so I always felt like I was a one-time thing for them. It's hard to say, but it's like this thought has just become a part of who I am.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like these feelings of not being wanted may be deeply rooted in your childhood experiences and may be influenced by the dynamics of your family. It's interesting that you mention being the center of attention, which can sometimes be a double-edged sword - on one hand, it's nice to have your parents' attention, but on the other hand, it may have created a sense of pressure or expectation. Can you tell me more about what it was like for you to be the only child, and how you think that may have contributed to these feelings of not being wanted?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah, it's weird, because on one hand, I loved being the only child, my parents could give me all their attention, and I never had to share them with anyone. But on the other hand, sometimes I felt like I was just a substitute for having a sibling, like my parents would have preferred to have a child of the opposite gender or something. And now, looking back, it's like... I don't know, maybe I was just trying to fill a void or something.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like being the only child had its benefits, but also created some uncertainty and potential feelings of not meeting your parents' expectations. It's interesting that you mention feeling like you might have been a substitute for a sibling, and that's a really important thing to explore. Can you tell me more about what you mean by trying to fill a void? What do you think you were trying to fill, and how do you think that's related to these feelings of not being wanted?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah, I think I was trying to fill the void of not having a sibling, maybe trying to get the attention and affection that I felt was missing from my life.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you were trying to compensate for the lack of sibling relationship by seeking attention and affection from your parents, which may have created a sense of pressure to be perfect or to constantly meet their needs. This could have led to feelings of being on edge, constantly seeking validation, and never feeling like you're good enough. And now, as an adult, these feelings of not being wanted may be manifesting as a deep-seated sense of insecurity and self-doubt. Is that something that resonates with you, or am I misunderstanding what you're trying to say?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah, that makes sense to me. I think I can see how my desire for attention and affection from my parents could have led to these feelings of inadequacy and self-doubt. It's like, I was trying to prove to myself and my parents that I was worthy of love and attention, but in doing so, I may have created this constant need for validation that's hard to shake.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you've been trying to find a sense of validation and self-worth by seeking attention and affection from your parents, but in doing so, you may have created a sense of emptiness or void that's hard to fill. It's as if you were trying to fill a hole in your heart by constantly seeking external validation, rather than developing a sense of self-worth from within. Can you tell me more about what you think would happen if you were able to let go of this need for external validation and instead focus on developing a sense of self-worth from within?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah, I think that would be really hard, because I'm not sure what I would do with myself if I wasn't constantly seeking validation from others. It's like, I don't know how to be happy with just being myself, without needing someone else to tell me I'm good enough.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you've been living your life trying to prove to yourself and others that you're worthy of love and attention, which has led to a sense of emptiness and self-doubt. It's as if you've been trying to fill a hole in your heart with external validation, rather than developing a sense of self-worth from within.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think what's even harder is that I've been trying to prove to myself and my parents that I'm worthy of love and attention for so long, that it's become a part of who I am, and it's hard to imagine being without that constant need for validation.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you've been living with this need for validation and attention for so long that it's become a deeply ingrained pattern, and it's hard to imagine being without it. But I want to gently challenge you to consider what would happen if you were able to let go of this need for external validation and instead focus on developing a sense of self-worth from within. What if you were able to cultivate a sense of self-love and acceptance, regardless of what others think or do? How might that change your experience of yourself and the world around you?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think that's a really interesting idea, the idea of cultivating self-love and acceptance, but it's hard for me to imagine what that would look like in practice. How do I go about doing that, especially when it feels like I've been doing this for so long and it's just a part of who I am now?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're wondering how to break free from this pattern of seeking external validation and cultivate a sense of self-love and acceptance instead. That's a huge undertaking, and it's natural to feel uncertain about where to start. One way to begin might be to practice self-compassion and mindfulness. This could involve setting aside time each day to focus on your breath, body, and emotions, and gently acknowledging your thoughts and feelings without judgment. It might also involve writing down things you appreciate about yourself, or finding activities that bring you joy and fulfillment, regardless of whether others notice or appreciate them. By gradually shifting your focus from external validation to internal self-care, you may start to develop a sense of self-love and acceptance that's not dependent on others. Would you like to explore this idea further?</div>

                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I'm starting to realize that my need for validation from my parents has been a way to cope with feelings of rejection and loneliness, but it's also been a constant source of anxiety and self-doubt.

                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're starting to uncover some deep-seated patterns and emotions that have been driving your need for validation.

What small steps do you think you could take to start shifting your focus away from external validation and towards internal self-care?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think I need to work on accepting that my parents' decision to have only one child is their own, and it doesn't define my worth as a person. I need to focus on developing a sense of self-love and acceptance, and not rely on external validation to feel good about myself. I'm not sure how to do that, but I'm willing to try.</div>

                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think that's a really good point, and it's something that I've been trying to work on in my own way. But it's hard for me to imagine what it would be like to not have that constant need for validation. I've been so used to seeking it out and proving myself to others that it's hard for me to imagine a life without it.</div>
