                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Hello Martha, itâ€™s nice to meet you. What brings you here today?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I'm here because I'm experiencing extreme anxiety and fear about my position in the church choir. It's gotten to the point where it's affecting my daily life.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>I'm so sorry to hear that, Martha. It sounds like this anxiety is really impacting your daily life. Can you tell me more about what's specifically causing you to feel this way about your position in the church choir? Is it a performance anxiety, a fear of making mistakes, or something else entirely?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I don't know why I'm even here. I just can't seem to shake off this feeling that I'm going to get kicked out of the choir. It's like a constant voice in my head, telling me that I'm not good enough and that I'll fail. I've been trying to push it away, but it only seems to get worse.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>That constant voice in your head can be really debilitating, Martha. It sounds like you're experiencing some self-doubt and fear of rejection. Have you noticed any specific situations or interactions that might be triggering this voice, or is it more of a general feeling that's been building up over time?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I don't know...I just feel like I'm just not good enough, and it's like, what's the point of even trying? Maybe I'm just not meant to be in the choir. And then I start thinking about all the times I've messed up, and it's just a never-ending cycle of self-doubt and fear. I don't know how to stop it.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like this self-doubt and fear have become a bit of a tangled web for you, Martha. It's like you're stuck in this cycle of negative thoughts and feelings. Can you tell me more about these 'times you've messed up' in the choir? What specifically happened, and how did you feel about it at the time?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I don't know...it's just little things, like forgetting the words to a song or messing up a harmony. And then I start thinking about how everyone must be judging me, and I just feel like I'm going to get kicked out. I've been replaying those moments over and over in my head, and it's like I'm stuck on repeat. I don't know how to break free from this cycle of self-doubt and fear.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like those little mistakes in the choir have taken on a life of their own in your mind, Martha. It's like you're reliving those moments over and over, and they've become a source of great anxiety for you. Can you imagine, for a moment, that those mistakes aren't a reflection of your worth as a person or a singer? That you're not defined by those small errors? How might that change the way you think about yourself and your role in the choir?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I don't know...it's hard for me to imagine that those mistakes aren't a reflection of my worth. It's like, if I'm not perfect, then I'm not good enough. And that fear of not being good enough is what's driving all this self-doubt and anxiety. I guess I just feel like I'm stuck between this fear of failure and this fear of rejection. I don't know how to break free from it.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like this fear of not being good enough has become a deeply ingrained part of your self-identity, Martha. It's like you're caught between the fear of not being good enough and the fear of rejection. Can we explore this idea of perfectionism a bit further? What does 'being perfect' mean to you, and how do you think it would affect your relationships with others and your own sense of self-worth if you were to accept that perfection is not possible?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I know you're trying to help me, but it's just so hard to shake off this feeling of inadequacy. I feel like I'm stuck in this never-ending cycle of self-doubt and fear, and I don't know how to break free. I've been replaying those moments in my head over and over, and it's like I'm stuck in a rut. I just feel like I'm not good enough, and that's all that matters.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're feeling really trapped by this sense of inadequacy, Martha. It's like you're stuck in a cycle of negative thoughts and feelings, and it's hard for you to imagine a different way of thinking about yourself and your role in the choir. Can you imagine, for a moment, that this feeling of inadequacy is not a fixed part of who you are, but rather a thought pattern that you can work with? That it's not necessarily a reflection of your worth as a person or a singer, but rather a coping mechanism that's developed to deal with the fear of rejection and failure?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I understand what you're saying, but it's hard for me to see things any differently. I've been feeling this way for so long, and it's become such a part of who I am. I don't know how to just imagine a different way of thinking about myself. It feels like I've been stuck in this rut for so long, and I don't know how to climb out of it.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like this sense of inadequacy has become a deeply ingrained part of your identity, Martha. It's not uncommon for our thoughts and feelings to feel like a fixed part of who we are, but it's actually possible to challenge and change them. Would you be willing to work together to explore some techniques for reframing your thoughts and building a more compassionate relationship with yourself? Sometimes, just acknowledging that our thoughts are not facts can be a powerful step towards freedom from their grip. What do you say? Would you like to try some exercises or strategies to help you break free from this cycle of self-doubt and fear?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I don't know, counselor. I feel like I've tried so many times to break free from this cycle of self-doubt and fear, but it's just like I'm stuck in quicksand. The more I try to pull myself out, the deeper I sink. I don't know if there's any hope for me.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're feeling really hopeless and stuck, Martha. I want you to know that I'm here to support you, and I believe that change is possible. It's not uncommon for people to feel like they're stuck in a pattern of negative thinking and feeling, but it's actually possible to break free from it. Would you be willing to take small steps towards challenging these negative thoughts and building a more compassionate relationship with yourself? Sometimes, just acknowledging that our thoughts are not facts can be a powerful step towards freedom from their grip. Let's start by exploring some techniques for reframing your thoughts and building self-compassion.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I don't know, counselor. It's just that I've been feeling so stuck and hopeless for so long, and I don't know how to shake off this feeling of inadequacy. I've tried to push it away, but it only seems to get worse. I feel like I'm just not good enough, and that's all that matters.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're feeling really overwhelmed and stuck, Martha. I want you to know that I'm here to support you, and I believe that change is possible. Sometimes, when we're feeling stuck, it can be helpful to break down the problem into smaller, more manageable pieces. Would you be willing to try that with me? Let's take a step back and focus on one specific thought pattern or feeling that's causing you distress. We can work together to challenge that thought and explore ways to build a more compassionate relationship with yourself. How does that sound?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I don't know, counselor. It's just that I've been feeling so stuck and hopeless for so long, and I don't know how to shake off this feeling of inadequacy. I've tried to push it away, but it only seems to get worse. I feel like I'm just not good enough, and that's all that matters.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Martha, it sounds like you're feeling really overwhelmed and stuck in this cycle of self-doubt and fear. I want to acknowledge that it's okay to feel that way, and that it's not uncommon for people to get stuck in these patterns of negative thinking. But I also want to let you know that you're not alone, and that I'm here to support you. Would you be willing to take a small step towards challenging these negative thoughts and building a more compassionate relationship with yourself? Maybe we can start by identifying one specific thought or feeling that's causing you distress, and then work together to explore ways to challenge that thought and build a more compassionate relationship with yourself.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I feel like I'm trapped in this never-ending cycle of self-doubt and fear, and I don't know how to break free. I've been going over the same thoughts and feelings in my head over and over, and it's like I'm stuck in a rut. I feel like I'm not good enough, and that's all that matters. It's hard for me to imagine a different way of thinking about myself, because it's become such a part of who I am.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Martha, I can sense how stuck and hopeless you're feeling in this cycle of self-doubt and fear. It's as if you're trapped in a never-ending loop of negative thoughts and feelings, and it's hard for you to imagine a different way of thinking about yourself. I want you to know that I'm here to support you, and I believe that change is possible. But I also want to acknowledge that it's not easy to break free from these patterns of thinking. It's like trying to climb out of a deep well, and it can feel overwhelming.But here's the thing, Martha: the fact that you're aware of this cycle and you're willing to talk about it is a huge step forward. It means that you're already taking small steps towards breaking free. And I want to encourage you to keep going, even if it feels like it's just a tiny step forward. Because every small step you take towards challenging these negative thoughts and building a more compassionate relationship with yourself is a step closer towards freedom.So, let's take a small step together. Let's identify one specific thought or feeling that's causing you distress right now. Is it the fear of not being good enough? Is it the fear of rejection? Is it the thought that you're not worthy of being in the choir? Whatever it is, let's take a closer look at it together and see if we can challenge it in some way. Maybe we can even find a way to reframe it or reframe your relationship with yourself. What do you say? Are you willing to take that small step with me?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>It's hard for me to even acknowledge that thought, because it feels so deeply ingrained in who I am.

                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Martha, I can sense how difficult it is for you to acknowledge that thought, and I want to acknowledge that it's okay to feel that way. It's like you're trying to confront a part of yourself that feels deeply ingrained and hard to change. But I want to encourage you to keep going, even if it feels like it's just a tiny step forward. Because every small step you take towards acknowledging and challenging that thought is a step closer towards freedom.Let's take a closer look at that thought together. What does it feel like when you think that thought? What emotions arise when you think about not being good enough? Is it a feeling of shame, inadequacy, or something else entirely? Can you describe it to me?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>It's a feeling of deep disappointment and sadness. It's like I'm failing myself and everyone around me. I feel like I'm not good enough, and that's all that matters.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Martha, it sounds like that thought is closely tied to feelings of disappointment and sadness. It's like you're carrying around a heavy weight of self-doubt and inadequacy. I want you to know that it's okay to feel that way, and it's not uncommon for people to struggle with these kinds of feelings. But I also want to encourage you to consider that these feelings might not be entirely accurate. Would you be willing to explore with me how these feelings might be impacting your daily life, and how we might be able to challenge them in a way that's more compassionate and gentle towards yourself?</div>

She's been trying to push these thoughts away, but they just keep coming back and it's like she's going crazy. She feels like she's trapped in this quicksand and the more she tries to pull herself out, the deeper she sinks.In this moment, it's important for the counselor to acknowledge Martha's feelings and offer support.

It's like you're trapped in a never-ending loop of negative thoughts and feelings, and it's hard for you to imagine a different way of thinking about yourself. I want you to know that I'm here to support you, and I believe that change is possible. But I also want to acknowledge that it's not easy to break free from these patterns of thinking. It's like trying to climb out of a deep well, and it can feel overwhelming.However, I want to encourage you to keep going, even if it feels like it's just a tiny step forward. Because every small step you take towards challenging these negative thoughts and building a more compassionate relationship with yourself is a step closer towards freedom.Let's take a small step together. Let's identify one specific thought or feeling that's causing you distress right now. Is it the fear of not being good enough? Is it the fear of rejection? Is it the thought that you're not worthy of being in the choir? Whatever it is, let's take a closer look at it together and see if we can challenge it in some way. Maybe we can even find a way to reframe it or reframe your relationship with yourself. What do you say? Are you willing to take that small step with me?</div>
