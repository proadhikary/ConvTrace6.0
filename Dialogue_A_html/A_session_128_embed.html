                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Leroy, it's nice to meet you. Could you tell me a bit about what brings you here today?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Iâ€™ve been feeling really inadequate lately. It feels like no matter how hard I work, I'll never be able to afford the lifestyle I want. I see people around me living lavishly, and it just makes me feel worse.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Can you tell me more about what you mean by the lifestyle you want? What specific things do you feel like you're missing out on, and how do you think it would improve your sense of adequacy if you were able to achieve it?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>To be honest, I've always felt like I'm stuck in a rut, and I see others my age who have achieved more - they have better jobs, travel, and can afford nice things. They seem to have their lives together, and it's like I'm just stuck in a mediocre existence. I feel like I'm constantly comparing myself to others, and it's exhausting.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're experiencing a sense of discontent and frustration with your current situation, and that's making you feel like you're not measuring up to your own expectations. Can you help me understand what you mean by having a better job? Is it about earning more money, having a certain title or prestige, or something else entirely? What specific aspects of those others' lives are you comparing yourself to, and what do you think would happen if you were able to achieve those things?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah, it's not just about earning more money, it's about having a sense of fulfillment and purpose. I feel like my job is just a means to make a living, but it's not something I'm passionate about. And when I see others who have found their passion and are making a living doing what they love, it just makes me feel like I'm missing out.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're craving a sense of purpose and fulfillment in your work, and comparing yourself to others who have found that is amplifying your feelings of inadequacy. Can you help me understand what you think would happen if you were able to find a job that aligns with your passions? Would it give you a sense of validation or self-worth, and what are some small steps you've taken in the past to explore other career paths or pursue your interests outside of work?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I've actually taken a few online courses in the past to learn about graphic design, something I've always been interested in. But, I never followed through with it because I was scared of leaving my secure job and not being able to make a living.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you've already taken some steps towards exploring your passion for graphic design, but were held back by fears and concerns about financial security. Can you help me understand what specifically is driving your fear of leaving your secure job? Is it the fear of uncertainty, the fear of not being able to make ends meet, or something else entirely? And how do you think exploring your passion for graphic design could help you move towards a sense of fulfillment and purpose, even if it's not a guaranteed financially stable path?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think my fear of leaving my secure job is mainly driven by the uncertainty of not knowing what the future holds. I've worked hard to build a stable income and don't want to risk losing that. But, at the same time, I feel like I'm just going through the motions at my current job and not really living up to my potential.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're caught between the desire to play it safe and the desire to pursue something that aligns with your passions. It's understandable to be hesitant about leaving a secure job, especially when there's uncertainty about the future. But, it's also important to consider the potential costs of not pursuing your passions, including feelings of stagnation and disconnection from your sense of purpose. Can you help me understand what you think would happen if you were to take a small step towards exploring graphic design, such as taking another online course or reaching out to someone in the field for informational interview? What would be the worst-case scenario, and what would be the best-case scenario?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think the worst-case scenario would be that I fail at graphic design and have to go back to my old job, but at least I would have tried. The best-case scenario would be that I find a way to make a living doing something I'm passionate about and that gives me a sense of fulfillment and purpose.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're holding back from pursuing your passion for graphic design due to fear of uncertainty and the potential risk of losing financial stability. But, it's also clear that you're not satisfied with your current job and feel like you're not living up to your potential. Taking small steps towards exploring graphic design could be a way to test the waters and gain some clarity. What do you think would happen if you were to take a small step, like reaching out to someone in the field for informational interview or taking another online course? Would you feel like you're taking a risk, or would it feel like a small investment in your own growth and fulfillment?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think taking a small step towards exploring graphic design could be a way to test the waters and gain some clarity. It would feel like a small investment in my own growth and fulfillment, and I think it would be a good way to start exploring my passion without committing to a drastic change.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're considering taking a small step towards exploring your passion for graphic design, and that's a great place to start. I want to acknowledge that it's taking courage to even consider making a change, especially when it's uncertain. What would it mean to you if you were to take that small step and find that it aligns with your values and passions? What would that look like, and how do you think it could impact your sense of fulfillment and purpose?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think if I were to take that small step and find that graphic design aligns with my values and passions, it would mean a lot to me. It would mean that I'm not just going through the motions in my current job, but that I'm actually living up to my potential. It would give me a sense of purpose and fulfillment, and it would make me feel like I'm not stuck in a rut anymore.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like taking that small step towards exploring graphic design could be a turning point for you, allowing you to tap into your passions and values, and potentially leading to a greater sense of purpose and fulfillment. Can you help me understand what it would mean to you to have that sense of purpose and fulfillment, and how you think it would impact your relationships and overall well-being?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>It would mean everything to me. Having a sense of purpose and fulfillment would give me a sense of direction and motivation, and it would make me feel like I'm truly living my life. It would also make me a better person, and I think it would positively impact my relationships with others. I would be more present and engaged with the people around me, and I would be able to build deeper connections with them.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like having a sense of purpose and fulfillment would have a profound impact on your life, allowing you to feel more directed, motivated, and connected with others. Can you help me understand what specific changes you would make in your relationships if you were to have this sense of purpose and fulfillment? For example, would you be more likely to take on new projects or responsibilities, or would you be more present and engaged in your daily interactions with others?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think having a sense of purpose and fulfillment would make me more confident in my relationships, and I would be more likely to take on new projects or responsibilities because I would feel like I'm making a meaningful contribution.</div>

It's scary to think about leaving my secure job, but maybe it's also an opportunity to find a sense of purpose and fulfillment that I've been missing.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're starting to shift your focus from what's lacking in your life to what you're grateful for.

But it's also important to recognize that you're not stuck in your current situation. You have the power to make small steps towards exploring your passions and values, and that could lead to a greater sense of purpose and fulfillment.

How do you think that could impact your sense of fulfillment and purpose?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think you're right, I have been focusing on what I'm missing out on, and that's been draining my energy and sense of fulfillment.

                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah, I think taking a step back and focusing on the things I'm grateful for can be really helpful. I'm grateful for my job, even though it's not my passion, it provides a stable income and allows me to support myself. I'm also grateful for my friends and family, who are always there for me. And I'm grateful for the opportunity to explore graphic design, which is something I've always been interested in.</div>
