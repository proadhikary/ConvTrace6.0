                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Hi Blake, welcome to our session. It's great to have you here. Can you tell me what has brought you in today?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I've been feeling pretty down about my cooking skills lately. It all started a few months ago when I burnt some spaghetti sauce, and since then, I can't seem to shake the feeling that I'm just not good at cooking.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like that one incident with the burnt spaghetti sauce has really stuck with you and has led to a sense of self-doubt in the kitchen. Can you tell me more about what was going through your mind when that happened? What did you think to yourself after the sauce burnt?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>That's a great question. When the sauce burnt, I thought to myself, I'm such a failure. I'm not even able to cook a simple spaghetti sauce. What's wrong with me? And after that, every time I cook, I keep thinking about that moment and how I'm not good enough. It's like my mind is replaying that negative self-talk over and over again.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like that negative self-talk has really taken root and is now influencing your thoughts and feelings about cooking. It's interesting that you mention your mind is replaying that negative self-talk over and over again. Can you tell me more about what you think is driving this replaying of those thoughts? Is it like you're trying to punish yourself or reinforce some kind of belief about yourself?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>That's a great point. I think I am trying to punish myself by replaying those negative thoughts. It's like my mind is trying to make me feel guilty for not being perfect, and I'm allowing it to happen. I feel like I'm stuck in this loop of self-criticism, and it's hard for me to break free from it.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're experiencing a lot of self-criticism and self-punishment, which can be really overwhelming and difficult to break free from. Can you tell me more about what you think would happen if you were to let go of those negative thoughts and just focus on the present moment while cooking? What would that look like for you?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>That's a great question. I think if I were to let go of those negative thoughts, I would be able to enjoy cooking more and focus on the process rather than the outcome. I would be able to learn from my mistakes and see them as opportunities to improve, rather than as failures. I would also be able to appreciate the fact that I'm still able to cook and provide for my family, even if I'm not perfect.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're carrying around a lot of emotional weight from that one incident, and it's affecting your ability to enjoy cooking and have a positive relationship with it. It's interesting that you mention wanting to focus on the process rather than the outcome. Can you tell me more about what that would look like for you? What specific thoughts or feelings do you think would arise if you were to shift your focus away from the outcome and towards the process of cooking?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think if I were to focus on the process of cooking, I would be able to let go of the pressure to be perfect and instead enjoy the experience of cooking. I would be able to pay attention to the sensations of chopping the vegetables, the smell of the sauce simmering, and the sound of the sizzling meat. I would be able to appreciate the simple pleasures of cooking and not get caught up in the fear of making a mistake. It's like I would be able to reframe my cooking experience from a place of control and perfection to a place of curiosity and exploration.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like reframing your mindset around cooking from a place of control and perfection to a place of curiosity and exploration could be really liberating for you. It's amazing how much emotional weight you've been carrying around since that incident with the burnt spaghetti sauce. Can you tell me more about what you think would be the first step in making this shift, in starting to focus more on the process and less on the outcome?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think the first step would be to become more aware of when I'm slipping into those negative thoughts and self-criticism. Maybe I could take a deep breath, pause, and remind myself that it's okay to make mistakes and that I'm not defined by one burnt spaghetti sauce. I could also try to reframe those negative thoughts by telling myself that it's just a mistake, and that I can learn from it. Maybe I could even practice self-compassion by acknowledging that everyone makes mistakes, including professional chefs.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're already taking the first step towards being more aware of your thoughts and emotions while cooking. Noticing when you're slipping into negative self-talk and taking a deep breath to pause and reflect is a great start. I'd like to encourage you to take it a step further by practicing self-compassion and acknowledgment of your imperfections. Remember, everyone makes mistakes, and it's okay not to be perfect. What do you think would happen if you were to acknowledge and accept your imperfections in the kitchen, rather than trying to suppress or deny them?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think acknowledging and accepting my imperfections in the kitchen would be incredibly liberating. It would allow me to stop beating myself up over every little mistake and instead focus on the process of cooking, which is something I actually enjoy. By accepting that I'm not perfect, I would be able to learn from my mistakes and move forward without getting stuck in negative self-talk. It's like I would be giving myself permission to make mistakes and be human, which would be a huge weight off my shoulders.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like acknowledging and accepting your imperfections in the kitchen would be a powerful step towards freedom from self-criticism and negative self-talk. By embracing your imperfections, you'd be able to stop beating yourself up over mistakes and instead focus on the process of cooking, which you mentioned you actually enjoy. What do you think would happen if you were to practice self-compassion and acknowledgment of your imperfections in the kitchen, and how would you go about doing that?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think practicing self-compassion and acknowledging my imperfections in the kitchen would involve being kind and gentle with myself when I make mistakes. I would remind myself that everyone makes mistakes, even professional chefs, and that it's okay to not be perfect. I would try to focus on the present moment and the process of cooking, rather than dwelling on past mistakes or worrying about future ones. I would also try to be more patient and understanding with myself, and not beat myself up over every little mistake.</div>

By being kind and gentle with myself when I make mistakes, I would be able to learn from them and move forward without getting stuck in negative self-talk.

                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're really getting in touch with the emotional weight of your negative self-talk and self-criticism in the kitchen.

What do you think would happen if you were to take it a step further and actually allow yourself to make mistakes and learn from them, rather than trying to control everything and avoid failure?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think allowing myself to make mistakes and learn from them would be a huge shift for me. It would mean letting go of the need to be perfect and embracing the fact that everyone makes mistakes. I would need to reframe my thinking around mistakes as opportunities for growth and learning, rather than failures that define my worth. It would also mean being kind and gentle with myself when I make mistakes, rather than beating myself up over them. I think that would allow me to build confidence in my cooking skills and feel more comfortable in the kitchen, without the weight of self-criticism holding me back.</div>
