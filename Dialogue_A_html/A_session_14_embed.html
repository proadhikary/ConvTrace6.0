                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Hi Jessica, I'm glad you could make it today. How are you feeling right now?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I've been feeling overwhelmed at work, especially with the added pressure of my bipolar disorder. It's making me second-guess my abilities and whether I can handle my responsibilities as a nurse.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Wow, it sounds like you're carrying a heavy load right now, both at work and personally. It's really brave of you to share that with me. Can you tell me more about what's specifically feeling overwhelming to you at work? Is it the workload, the pressure to meet certain standards, or something else entirely?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah, it's all of those things, I guess. I just feel like I'm always struggling to keep up and that my bipolar disorder makes it even harder. Sometimes I think I'm doing okay, and then something unexpected happens and I feel like I'm completely falling apart. It's like I'm constantly walking on eggshells, waiting for the other shoe to drop.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>I can imagine how frustrating and scary that must feel, Jessica. It sounds like you're constantly trying to balance your responsibilities with the unpredictability of your bipolar disorder. Can you tell me more about what 'falling apart' means to you? What are some of the thoughts or feelings that come up for you when you're in that place?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah, it's just really hard for me to accept that I'm not perfect, and that my bipolar disorder affects my work. I feel like I'm constantly judged by my colleagues and patients, and it's like they can see me breaking apart, even when I'm trying to put on a good face. I don't know how to deal with these feelings of inadequacy and fear of being found out.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>I can see why you'd feel like you're walking on eggshells, Jessica, constantly worried about being judged or found out. It sounds like you're putting a lot of pressure on yourself to present a perfect exterior, even when you're struggling internally. Can you tell me more about what 'being found out' means to you? What are you afraid will happen if people discover your struggles with bipolar disorder?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah, I'm just really afraid that if people find out, they'll think I'm not capable of doing my job or that I'm not taking care of my patients properly. I'm worried that they'll see me as weak or flawed, and that my relationships with my colleagues and patients will suffer as a result.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're carrying a lot of shame and fear around the idea of being found out, Jessica. It's as if you're worried that if people discover your struggles, they'll not only judge you but also reject you. Can you explore with me why you think that rejection would be so devastating? Is there a particular experience or relationship in your past that has led you to believe that being vulnerable and imperfect would lead to abandonment or rejection?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think it's because when I was younger, my parents were always pushing me to be perfect, to be the best. They would get really upset when I made mistakes or didn't meet their expectations. I think that's where this fear of being found out and rejected comes from. I've always felt like I need to be perfect to be loved and accepted.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like your parents' high expectations and reactions to your mistakes have had a profound impact on your sense of self-worth and your fears around being imperfect. It's as if you've internalized the message that you're only lovable and acceptable when you're perfect. Can you tell me more about what it was like growing up with parents who had such high expectations? How did you feel when you couldn't meet their expectations?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah, it was really tough. I always felt like I was walking on eggshells, never knowing when I'd do something wrong and get criticized. I think that's why I've always been so driven to be perfect, to prove to myself and others that I'm capable and worthy of love and acceptance. But it's exhausting, and I'm starting to realize that it's not sustainable.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like your parents' expectations created a sense of constant pressure and criticism, leaving you feeling like you were never good enough. It's no wonder you've been driven to be perfect, as a way to prove your worth and avoid criticism. Can you explore with me how you've been using perfectionism as a way to cope with this pressure, and what you think would happen if you were to let go of this need to be perfect?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah, I think I've been using perfectionism as a way to distract myself from the uncertainty and unpredictability of my bipolar disorder. If I'm perfect, then I can't fail or make mistakes, and that's comforting to me. But it's exhausting, and I'm starting to realize that it's not sustainable.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you've been using perfectionism as a way to cope with the uncertainty and unpredictability of your bipolar disorder, Jessica. It's as if you're saying, If I'm perfect, then I can't fail or make mistakes, and that's comforting to me. But it's exhausting, and you're starting to realize that it's not sustainable. Can you explore with me what you think would happen if you were to let go of this need to be perfect? What would you gain, and what would you risk losing?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think that if I let go of the need to be perfect, I would gain more freedom and flexibility in my life, and I might be able to focus more on the things that truly matter to me, like my relationships with my family and friends. But I'm also worried about what others would think of me, and whether they would still respect and value me if I'm not perfect. I'm scared of being seen as flawed or imperfect, and I'm not sure I could handle that.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're carrying a lot of fear around what others might think of you if you're not perfect, Jessica. It's as if you're worried that if you let go of this need to be perfect, you'll lose their respect and admiration. Can you explore with me why it's so important to you that others think highly of you? Is there a particular experience or relationship in your past that has led you to believe that being imperfect would lead to rejection or abandonment?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah, I think it's because I've always felt like I need to be perfect to be loved and accepted. I've always had this idea that I'm only lovable and acceptable when I'm perfect, and that's really hard for me to shake off.</div>

                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I've been thinking a lot about your questions, and I realize that I've been using my perfectionism as a way to cope with the uncertainty of my bipolar disorder. It's like I'm saying, If I'm perfect, then I can't fail or make mistakes, and that's comforting to me. But it's exhausting, and I'm starting to realize that it's not sustainable. I'm scared of being seen as flawed or imperfect, and I'm not sure I could handle that.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're grappling with the idea that your perfectionism is not only exhausting but also unsustainable. You're worried about being seen as flawed or imperfect, and you're not sure you could handle that. Can you explore with me what it would mean for you to be imperfect, not in a catastrophic sense, but in a more nuanced way? What would it look like to be imperfectly human, with all its flaws and uncertainties? Would that mean you're less worthy of love and acceptance, or could it mean something different?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think it's interesting that you're asking me to consider what it would mean to be imperfectly human. I've always thought that being imperfect meant being broken or flawed, but maybe that's not the only way to look at it. Maybe being imperfectly human means being vulnerable, authentic, and real. It means acknowledging that I'm not perfect and that it's okay to make mistakes. It means being willing to take risks and be imperfectly human. And maybe that's what I need to do, to let go of my need for perfection and accept that I'm imperfectly human.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Jessica, I can sense a sense of relief and openness in your words as you begin to explore the idea of being imperfectly human. It sounds like you're starting to see that perfectionism has been a coping mechanism for you, but it's also been exhausting and unsustainable. You're worried about being seen as flawed or imperfect, but I want to gently challenge that notion. Being imperfectly human doesn't mean you're broken or flawed; it means you're human. It means you're capable of making mistakes, learning from them, and growing as a result. It means you're vulnerable, authentic, and real. Would you be willing to explore this idea further with me? What would it look like for you to be imperfectly human, and what might you gain from embracing that?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think so. I've been carrying this weight of perfectionism around for so long, and it's exhausting. I'm tired of pretending to be someone I'm not, and I'm tired of feeling like I have to be perfect all the time. I want to be able to be myself, flaws and all, and not have to worry about what others think. I want to be able to take risks and make mistakes, and I want to be able to learn from them. I want to be able to be imperfectly human, and I think that's what I need to do to truly be happy and fulfilled.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Jessica, it sounds like you're at a crossroads, where you're recognizing that your perfectionism has been a coping mechanism, but it's also been exhausting and unsustainable.
