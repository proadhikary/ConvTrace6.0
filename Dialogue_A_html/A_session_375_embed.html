                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Hi Chase, it's nice to meet you. I understand that you're here to talk about some concerns you've been having. Can you tell me a bit about what's been going on?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I’ve tried to rationalize the situation, but I can't seem to shake off the feeling of being a failure. It's affecting my confidence in the kitchen, and I'm worried it might impact my relationship with my girlfriend as well.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>I can sense that this is a really tough spot for you, Chase. It sounds like you're beating yourself up over something that's happened in the kitchen, and it's affecting not just your cooking but also your relationships. Can you help me understand what specifically is going on that's making you feel like a failure? Was it a particular dish that didn't turn out right, or was it a criticism from someone else?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah, it was specifically the dessert I made for my girlfriend. I had spent hours preparing it, and she just didn't seem to enjoy it. Her reaction was really tough for me to handle, and I think it's because I put a lot of pressure on myself to make it perfect.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>I see. It sounds like you poured your heart and soul into this dessert, and her reaction was a huge disappointment. It's like you were expecting a certain response, and when you didn't get it, it felt like a personal failure. Can you tell me more about what you were hoping to get from her? Was it just that she would appreciate the effort you put into it, or was there something more you were hoping to get from her?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah, I think I was hoping for a sense of validation, not just for the dessert but also for myself as a cook. I wanted her to acknowledge that I had done a great job and that she enjoyed the meal. But when she didn't seem to care, it felt like all that effort was for nothing, and I started to doubt my abilities as a cook.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you were seeking not just a positive response to your cooking, but also a sense of self-worth and validation. You wanted to feel seen and acknowledged as a cook, and when that didn't happen, it led to feelings of failure and self-doubt. Can you tell me more about what you think would happen if you didn't get this validation? Would it change how you approach cooking or how you see yourself as a person?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah, I think if I didn't get this validation, I would start to question my identity as a cook and feel like I'm not good enough. I would probably become more anxious and self-doubting, and it would affect not just my cooking but also my relationships with others.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like the lack of validation you received from your girlfriend has triggered a deeper sense of self-doubt and uncertainty around your identity as a cook. It's as if you're tied to the idea that your worth is closely tied to your cooking abilities. Can you explore with me why you think this is the case? What experiences or messages have led you to believe that your self-worth is closely linked to your cooking?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah, I think it's because my parents have always been critical of my cooking, even when I was a kid. They would make comments like, You're not a real chef until you can make a perfect soufflé or You'll never be a great cook if you can't make a perfect dish. They would often compare me to other kids who were more skilled in the kitchen, and it made me feel like I was never good enough. I think those messages have stuck with me, and now when I don't get validation from others, it triggers those feelings of inadequacy and self-doubt.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like your parents' critical comments and comparisons have had a profound impact on your sense of self-worth and identity as a cook. It's as if you've internalized their expectations and have been carrying around a sense of inadequacy and self-doubt ever since. It's no wonder that when you don't receive validation from others, it triggers those same feelings. Can you tell me more about how you think this has affected your relationships with others? Have you found yourself striving for perfection or seeking validation from others in order to feel good about yourself, or has this had a more negative impact on your relationships?Client:</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah, I think it has definitely had a negative impact on my relationships. I've become more anxious and self-doubting, and I often feel like I need to prove myself to others in order to be accepted. I've started to avoid cooking for others because I'm afraid of getting criticized or rejected, and it's made me feel isolated and lonely. I've also become more critical of myself and others, and it's affected my relationships in a big way.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like your parents' critical comments and comparisons have had a profound impact on your sense of self-worth and identity as a cook, and it's affecting your relationships with others. It's like you're carrying around a heavy burden of self-doubt and inadequacy, and it's making it hard for you to connect with others on a deeper level. Can you think of any ways that you might be able to start letting go of this need for validation and perfection, and instead focus on the joy and pleasure of cooking for others?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah, I think that's a great point. I've been so focused on trying to prove myself and get validation from others that I've forgotten why I started cooking in the first place - for the joy of it. I need to remember that cooking is something I do because I love it, not because I'm trying to prove myself to others. I think if I can shift my focus back to the joy of cooking, I'll be able to let go of this need for validation and perfection, and I'll be able to connect with others on a deeper level.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you've been carrying around a lot of emotional baggage from your parents' critical comments and comparisons. It's no wonder that you're struggling with self-doubt and inadequacy, and that it's affecting your relationships with others. But I want to highlight the thing that you mentioned at the end, which is that you started cooking because you love it. Can you explore with me what that means to you? What is it about cooking that brings you joy? Is it the process of creating something new, the satisfaction of seeing people enjoy your food, or something else entirely?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think what brings me joy is the process of creating something new and the sense of accomplishment when it turns out well. I love the feeling of being in the kitchen, experimenting with new ingredients and techniques, and seeing how different flavors and textures come together. It's almost meditative for me, and it allows me to shut off my self-critical thoughts and just focus on the present moment. When I'm cooking, I feel like I'm in my own little world, and nothing else matters except for the food and the experience of creating it.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like cooking has become a source of joy and comfort for you, a way to escape from your self-critical thoughts and connect with your creative side. It's beautiful that you've found something that brings you such happiness and fulfillment. Can you think of ways you could incorporate more of this mind-set into your daily life, even when you're cooking for others? Maybe instead of focusing on the outcome or what others might think, you could focus on the process and the joy it brings you?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think that's a great idea. I've been so focused on trying to prove myself and get validation from others that I've forgotten why I started cooking in the first place - for the joy of it.

                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're really close to having a breakthrough, Chase.
