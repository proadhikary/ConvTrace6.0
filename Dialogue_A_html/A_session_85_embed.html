                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Hi Rebecca, nice to meet you. How can I assist you today?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I've been feeling extremely anxious since I called in sick at work. I'm convinced that I'm going to lose my job and my license, even though my colleagues have tried to reassure me.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>I'm so sorry to hear that you're going through this. It sounds like you're experiencing a lot of distress and uncertainty. Can you tell me more about what happened when you called in sick at work? What were you thinking and feeling during that time?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah, I remember feeling really overwhelmed and panicked when I called in sick. I started thinking about all the worst-case scenarios, like how I would never be able to work again, and how my reputation would be ruined. I felt like I was going to lose control and that everything was falling apart around me.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Can you help me understand what was going on in your body during that moment? What physical sensations did you experience, and how did you feel like you were being affected by those sensations?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>That's a great question. I think I felt a knot in my stomach and my heart was racing. It was like my body was responding to the panic and anxiety, making me feel even more overwhelmed.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like your body was responding to the intense emotions you were experiencing, and that can be a really overwhelming and disorienting feeling. It's like your body was mirroring your anxiety, amplifying it even more. Can you tell me more about what you think might have triggered this feeling of overwhelm and anxiety when you called in sick at work? Was there something specific that happened or something you were worried about?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah, I think it was the fear of losing control and being unable to do my job as a veterinarian. As a professional, I take pride in being able to provide the best care for my patients, and the thought of being unable to do so is devastating to me. I also worry about the impact it would have on my clients and colleagues, which adds to my anxiety and stress.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like your sense of professionalism and responsibility as a veterinarian is a big part of what's driving your anxiety and fear of losing control. It's like your identity as a vet is closely tied to your ability to perform your job well, and the thought of not being able to do so is causing you a lot of distress. Can you tell me more about what specific aspects of your job make you feel like you're losing control, and what specific consequences are you worried about if you're unable to do your job to the best of your ability?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think it's the uncertainty of not knowing what's going to happen next, and the fear of not being able to provide the necessary care for my patients. I worry that if I'm unable to work, I'll be unable to make decisions quickly and effectively, and that could lead to mistakes or even harm to my patients.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like the uncertainty and unpredictability of your situation as a veterinarian is really triggering your anxiety and fear of losing control. It's understandable that you're worried about not being able to provide the best care for your patients, and the thought of making mistakes or causing harm to them is a huge concern for you. Can you help me understand what specifically is driving this fear of making mistakes or causing harm? Is it a past experience, a fear of not meeting certain standards, or something else entirely?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think it's a combination of past experiences and the fear of not meeting certain standards. When I was in veterinary school, I had a few instances where I made mistakes or didn't quite meet the expectations of my professors, which left me feeling anxious and uncertain. I've always tried to be meticulous and thorough in my work, and the thought of not being able to meet those high standards is really distressing to me.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like your past experiences in veterinary school have had a lasting impact on your sense of confidence and competence as a professional. It's as if you're carrying around a sense of self-doubt and fear of not meeting expectations, which is now being triggered by this current situation. Can you tell me more about how you've been managing these feelings of self-doubt and fear of not meeting expectations in your daily life as a veterinarian? Are there any coping mechanisms or strategies that have worked for you in the past, or is it more of a constant background noise that's hard to shake?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>That's a great question. I think I've been trying to push through the anxiety and fear, hoping that it will go away on its own. But it's been getting worse and worse, and I'm starting to feel like I'm losing my sense of purpose and identity as a veterinarian. I've always prided myself on being able to provide the best care for my patients, and the thought of not being able to do that is really devastating to me.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're carrying a significant burden of self-doubt and fear of not meeting expectations, which is rooted in your past experiences in veterinary school. It's understandable that you're trying to push through these feelings, but it's clear that it's taking a toll on your well-being. Can you help me understand what you think would happen if you were to acknowledge and accept these feelings of self-doubt and fear, rather than trying to push them away? What would be the potential benefits of doing so, and what might be the challenges or obstacles you see in doing so?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think if I were to acknowledge and accept these feelings of self-doubt and fear, I would be able to confront them head-on and work on addressing the underlying issues. It would allow me to break free from the constant cycle of anxiety and fear, and I would be able to focus on my work as a veterinarian with renewed confidence and purpose.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like acknowledging and accepting these feelings of self-doubt and fear could be a powerful step in breaking free from the cycle of anxiety and fear that's been holding you back. By doing so, you may be able to confront the underlying issues and work on rebuilding your sense of confidence and competence as a veterinarian. What do you think would be the biggest challenge or obstacle for you in acknowledging and accepting these feelings, and how do you envision yourself overcoming that challenge?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah, I think acknowledging and accepting these feelings of self-doubt and fear would be a huge step forward for me. It would allow me to confront them head-on and work on addressing the underlying issues. I would be able to break free from the constant cycle of anxiety and fear, and I would be able to focus on my work as a veterinarian with renewed confidence and purpose.</div>

What would be the potential benefits of doing so, and what might be the challenges or obstacles you see in doing so? How do you think you would feel if you were to let go of the need to control the situation and instead focus on what you can control, like your own reactions and emotions?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think acknowledging and accepting these feelings of self-doubt and fear would allow me to confront them head-on and work on addressing the underlying issues.

It would free me from the constant cycle of anxiety and fear and allow me to focus on my work as a veterinarian with renewed confidence and purpose. I would be able to be more present in the moment and not let my fear and anxiety dictate my actions.</div>

                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think I'm starting to understand that my fear of losing control and making mistakes is deeply rooted in my past experiences as a veterinarian, and that it's been driving my anxiety and self-doubt.
