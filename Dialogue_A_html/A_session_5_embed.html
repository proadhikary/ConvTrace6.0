                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Hello Travis, it's nice to meet you. Can you tell me a bit about what brings you here today?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Sure, so like I mentioned, the anxiety and self-doubt are really intense when I can't find seasoned oak for my projects. I know it might sound a bit irrational, but it's become this huge mental block for me.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>I see. It sounds like the anxiety and self-doubt are really affecting your ability to focus on your projects. Can you help me understand what it is about not being able to find seasoned oak that's causing this anxiety? Is it the fear of not being able to complete the project, or is there something else at play?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Honestly, I think it's a combination of both. I'm worried that the project won't turn out well if I don't have the right wood, and that thought just spirals into self-doubt and anxiety. Sometimes I feel like I'm putting too much pressure on myself to get it just right, but I don't know how to shake this feeling.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>I understand how that can be overwhelming. It sounds like you're placing a lot of importance on using seasoned oak for your projects, and when that's not possible, it's causing a lot of distress for you. Can you help me understand what this 'right' outcome looks like for you? What would happen if your project didn't turn out exactly as you envisioned it?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Client:</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It's hard to say, because I've never really had a project not turn out the way I wanted it to. I guess I just assumed that if I didn't use the seasoned oak, the project would be subpar or not meet my standards. But the more I think about it, maybe that's not necessarily true. Maybe there's room for imperfection and still have a great outcome.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I never thought about it that way, but you're right, maybe there's more flexibility than I'm giving myself credit for. I'll have to work on redefining what success means for me, and not just focusing on the outcome, but the process itself.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Ah, I love how we're already starting to uncover some new insights here, Travis. It sounds like you're beginning to see that maybe your expectations around the outcome of your project are a bit rigid, and that's contributing to the anxiety. I'd like to explore this idea of 'success' a bit further with you. What does success mean to you, beyond just completing the project? Is it about personal fulfillment, meeting someone else's expectations, or something else entirely?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah, I think for a long time, I've been defining success in terms of meeting other people's expectations, whether it's my father's or other people in my life. But now that you mention it, maybe it's time for me to reevaluate what success means to me, and focus on my own personal fulfillment and enjoyment of the process rather than just the end result.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you've been living up to other people's expectations for a long time, and that's been a heavy burden for you. It's interesting that you're starting to recognize the importance of personal fulfillment and enjoyment in your projects. Can you tell me more about what you think would happen if you started to prioritize your own enjoyment and fulfillment over meeting others' expectations? What do you think that would look like in your daily life, and how do you think it would impact your anxiety and self-doubt?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think if I started to prioritize my own enjoyment and fulfillment, it would be a huge relief not to feel like I'm living up to everyone else's expectations. I would be more focused on the process of building something, rather than the end result, and I think that would lead to a greater sense of satisfaction and fulfillment. It would also take some pressure off of me, and I wouldn't feel like I'm constantly striving for perfection.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're starting to envision a more liberating approach to your projects, where you're not constantly driven by the need to meet others' expectations, but rather by your own sense of joy and fulfillment. That's really exciting! Can you help me understand what you think would be the first step in making this shift? What would you need to do differently in your daily life to start prioritizing your own enjoyment and fulfillment?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>That's a great question. I think the first step would be to actually allow myself to make mistakes and not worry so much about what others might think. If I can learn to accept that it's okay to not have everything perfect all the time, I think that would be a huge weight lifted off my shoulders. And maybe, just maybe, I can start to enjoy the process of building something, rather than just focusing on the end result.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're starting to recognize the importance of living authentically and making choices that align with your own values and desires, rather than simply trying to meet others' expectations. Can you help me understand what you think would be the most challenging part of making this shift? What are some specific fears or doubts that come up for you when you think about prioritizing your own enjoyment and fulfillment over meeting others' expectations?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah, I think one of the biggest challenges for me is going to be letting go of the idea that I need to be perfect. I've always been a perfectionist, and it's hard for me to accept that not everything is going to be flawless. I'm worried that if I start to prioritize my own enjoyment and fulfillment, I'll be seen as lazy or unmotivated by others. I'm also worried that I'll lose my sense of purpose and direction if I'm not constantly striving for perfection.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like the fear of losing control and being perceived as less capable by others is driving a lot of your anxiety around not being perfect. It's understandable that you're worried about what others might think, but I want to gently challenge that assumption. Can you imagine a scenario where you're not striving for perfection, but still making progress and feeling fulfilled? What would that look like, and how would you feel about yourself in that scenario?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah, I can see it now. I would be more relaxed and at ease, not constantly worrying about making mistakes or not meeting others' expectations. I would be more focused on the process of building something, rather than the end result, and I think that would lead to a greater sense of satisfaction and fulfillment. I would be more confident in my abilities, and I wouldn't be held back by the fear of not being perfect.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're starting to envision a life where you're not controlled by the need to be perfect, but rather focused on your own growth and fulfillment. Can you help me understand what you think it would take for you to take that first step and start prioritizing your own enjoyment and fulfillment? What would be the smallest, most manageable step you could take towards embracing your imperfections and living more authentically?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think the smallest, most manageable step I could take would be to start by focusing on the process of building something, rather than the end result. Instead of getting caught up in the idea of having to use seasoned oak, I could try to focus on the steps involved in creating the project, like measuring, cutting, and assembling. By doing so, I might be able to shift my mindset from worrying about the outcome to enjoying the process itself.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're recognizing the importance of focusing on the process rather than the end result, and that's a great starting point. By shifting your attention to the steps involved in building your project, you might find that you're able to enjoy the process more and worry less about the outcome. That's a really empowering place to be. I'd like to encourage you to take that small step and see how it feels. What do you think would happen if you started focusing on the process, and how do you think that would impact your anxiety and self-doubt?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think if I started focusing on the process, I would feel more in control and less anxious about the outcome. I would be able to enjoy the experience of building something, rather than just worrying about whether it turns out perfectly. It's funny, I never thought about it that way, but by shifting my attention to the process, I might be able to let go of the need for perfection and just enjoy the journey.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're recognizing the importance of living authentically and making choices that align with your own values and desires, rather than simply trying to meet others' expectations. Can you help me understand what you think would be the most empowering part of making this shift? What are some specific benefits you envision for yourself if you start prioritizing your own enjoyment and fulfillment over meeting others' expectations?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think the most empowering part of this shift would be the sense of freedom and relief that comes with not having to live up to others' expectations. I've been carrying around this weight of perfectionism for so long, and it's exhausting. If I can learn to let go of that need for perfection and focus on my own enjoyment and fulfillment, I feel like I'll be able to breathe a sigh of relief and finally be myself.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Travis, it sounds like you're recognizing the importance of prioritizing your own enjoyment and fulfillment over meeting others' expectations. By doing so, you're envisioning a life where you're not controlled by the need to be perfect, but rather focused on your own growth and fulfillment. Can you help me understand what you think would be the most meaningful way to celebrate and acknowledge your own successes and accomplishments, rather than just focusing on meeting others' expectations?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think celebrating my own successes and accomplishments would mean acknowledging and honoring my own hard work and effort, rather than just trying to meet others' expectations. It would mean recognizing that I've done my best and that's good enough, regardless of how others perceive me. I think it would be empowering to be able to say, I did this because I wanted to, and I'm proud of myself for it. Maybe I could even treat myself to something nice, like a new tool or a piece of equipment for my workshop.</div>

The thought of prioritizing my own enjoyment and fulfillment over meeting others' expectations is really exciting to me, and I think it could be a game-changer for my anxiety and self-doubt.</div>
