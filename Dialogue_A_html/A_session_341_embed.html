                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Hi Pamela, I'm glad you came in today. How are you feeling?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I'm just feeling overwhelmed with everything. I try so hard to get the kids to their events on time, but I always end up being late. It's like no matter what I do, I'm always failing.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>I can tell that you're really struggling with feeling like you're not meeting your expectations, especially when it comes to your kids. Can you tell me more about what's going on when you're getting ready to take them to their events? Is there something specific that's causing you to feel like you're always running behind?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>It's just that I have so much on my plate and I'm always worried that I'll forget something important, like signing a permission slip or bringing the right equipment. And then I'll get there and realize that I forgot something and it's just too late to go back and get it. It's like I'm constantly one step behind.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're carrying a lot of responsibility and feeling like you're constantly trying to keep up with everything, but struggling to do so. The fear of forgetting something important and being unable to go back and fix it is really causing you a lot of distress. Can you tell me more about what's driving this sense of responsibility? Is it a sense of obligation to your kids, or is there something else at play here?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I guess it's just because I feel like I'm supposed to be this perfect parent, you know? I mean, all the other parents seem to have it together, and I'm just stuck in this mess. It's like I'm the only one who's really struggling. And when I'm late, I just feel like I'm failing my kids, like I'm not good enough for them.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're putting a lot of pressure on yourself to be a perfect parent, and when you're not meeting those expectations, it's really affecting your self-esteem. It's like you're comparing yourself to others and feeling like you're not good enough. Can you tell me more about what you mean by all the other parents seem to have it together? Are they actually perfect, or are you just perceiving that they are?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I don't know, it just feels like they have their lives together, you know? They're always on time, they're always prepared, they always seem to know what's going on. And I'm just over here feeling like I'm completely lost and unorganized. It's like, I'm just not good enough to be one of those parents.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're experiencing a lot of self-doubt and feelings of inadequacy as a parent, and that's really tough. It's like you're putting a lot of pressure on yourself to be perfect, and when you're not meeting those expectations, it's really hurting your self-esteem. I want to gently challenge you on this idea that all the other parents have it together. Are you really sure that's true, or is that just a perception? Have you actually talked to any of these parents and asked how they're doing? Maybe they're struggling too, but they're just not sharing that with you.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah, I know it's not true, deep down. I've seen them struggling too, but I just don't want to admit it. I guess I'm just trying to hold myself to an impossible standard and when I fall short, it's devastating.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're being really hard on yourself and holding yourself to an unrealistic standard. It's like you're trying to be perfect, and when you're not, it's really hurting your self-esteem. I want to encourage you to be kinder to yourself and recognize that no one is perfect, not even the parents who seem to have it together. Everyone struggles, and it's okay to not be perfect. Can we explore this idea of being kinder to yourself and what that might look like in your daily life?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I suppose you're right, I have been putting a lot of pressure on myself to be perfect, and when I'm not, it's devastating. But it's hard to let go of that feeling that I need to be perfect for my kids. I feel like they're counting on me to be this perfect parent, and if I'm not, they'll be disappointed in me.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're carrying a lot of weight on your shoulders, feeling like you're responsible for your kids' happiness and well-being. It's like you're worried that if you're not perfect, you'll fail them. Can you tell me more about what you mean by they're counting on me to be this perfect parent? What specific things do you think they're counting on you for, and how do you think their lives would be affected if you weren't perfect?</div>

It's like you're worried that if you're not perfect, you'll fail them. Can we explore this idea of responsibility and what it means to be a good parent? What does being a good parent look like to you, and is it possible that it's not about being perfect?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I guess I just feel like I need to be the one to keep everything together, like I'm the only one who can keep my kids safe and happy. And if I'm not perfect, then I'm not doing my job well enough.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're carrying a huge burden of responsibility on your shoulders, feeling like you're the only one who can keep everything together for your kids. That's a massive weight to carry, and it's no wonder you're feeling overwhelmed. Can we explore this idea of being the only one who can keep everything together? Is it possible that your kids would be okay if things weren't perfect, if you weren't always on time or always prepared? Maybe they'd even learn to be more resilient and adaptable if they had to deal with a few imperfections now and then.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I'm starting to realize that I'm putting way too much pressure on myself to be perfect, and it's affecting my relationships with my kids. I'm constantly worried about disappointing them, but what if they're not as affected by my imperfections as I think they are? Maybe they're just fine with me being a little late or making mistakes sometimes.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're starting to recognize the impact of your perfectionism on your relationships with your kids. It's a big shift to consider that maybe they're not as dependent on your perfection as you think they are. Can you imagine what it would be like to let go of that pressure to be perfect and just be present with your kids, even if that means showing up a little late or making mistakes? How do you think that might change your dynamic with them?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I'm not sure, it's hard to imagine. I guess I've always thought that if I'm not perfect, then I'm not worthy of being a good parent. But what if that's just a myth that I've created for myself? What if my kids are okay with me being imperfect and making mistakes? That's a really scary thought, but also kind of freeing.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're starting to see that your perfectionism is not only affecting your relationships with your kids, but also your own well-being. It's like you're carrying this huge weight of responsibility on your shoulders, feeling like you're the only one who can keep everything together. And when you're not perfect, it's like you're failing not only yourself, but also your kids. Can we explore this idea of failure and what it means to you? What does it mean to fail as a parent, and is it possible that your kids would be okay with you making mistakes sometimes?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think I've been so focused on being perfect that I've forgotten what it means to be a good parent.

It's scary to think about, but it's also kind of freeing. I feel like a weight has been lifted off my shoulders just thinking about it.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're having a breakthrough moment here, Pamela. You're starting to realize that being a good parent isn't about being perfect, but about being present and loving your kids. That's a huge shift in perspective. Can you imagine what it would be like to approach parenting with that kind of mindset? What would change for you, and how do you think that would impact your relationships with your kids?</div>

                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're feeling a sense of relief and freedom just considering the idea that you don't have to be perfect to be a good parent. That's a huge step forward. I want to encourage you to keep exploring this idea and see what it might look like in your daily life. What would it mean for you to be present and loving with your kids, even when you make mistakes? How might that change your interactions with them, and what do you think that would look like in practice?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I'm still having trouble letting go of the idea that I need to be perfect for my kids.
