                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Hi Blake, welcome. I understand you're going through a rough time right now. Can you tell me more about what's been happening and how you're feeling?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>It's been tough because going to concerts means a lot to me. The thought of not being able to experience live music again is really overwhelming. I can't seem to shake off the fear that these events will keep getting canceled.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>I can sense how much live music means to you, Blake. It's like you're not just experiencing the music itself, but also the community and connection that comes with it. Can you tell me more about what specifically is scaring you about these events getting canceled? Is it the loss of that connection, or something else entirely?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Honestly, it's the thought of never getting to experience that rush of adrenaline and excitement when I'm in a crowd of people all united by the same passion for music. It's like, what's the point of even having hobbies or interests if we can't share them with others in a way that feels truly alive.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like the fear of losing that collective energy and excitement is really affecting you, Blake. It's almost as if you're worried that without that shared experience, your passions and interests will lose their spark. Can you tell me more about what you mean by truly alive? What does that feel like for you, and how do you think it's connected to your love of live music and concerts?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah, I think truly alive means feeling completely immersed and present in the moment. It's like my senses are heightened, and I'm fully connected to the music, the people around me, and even myself. It's hard to describe, but it's like my whole being is vibrating at the same frequency as the music. And when I'm in that state, nothing else matters – not even my own worries or fears. It's like my heart is swelling with joy and my soul is singing. Live music has a way of making me feel that way, and I'm terrified that without it, I'll lose that sense of connection and meaning.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like truly alive is a state of being that's deeply connected to your sense of purpose and identity, Blake. It's like you're not just experiencing the music, but you're also experiencing a deeper sense of connection to yourself and others. Can you tell me more about what you think would change for you if you lost that sense of connection and meaning? Would it be like a part of you was missing, or would it be more like a shift in your perspective or priorities?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think it would be like a part of me was missing. I would feel like I'm just going through the motions, doing things because I have to, but not because I truly want to. I wouldn't have that sense of purpose or direction, and I would feel lost and aimless. It's hard to imagine a life without that spark, that excitement, that feeling of being truly alive.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like the thought of losing that sense of purpose and connection is really daunting for you, Blake. It's as if you're worried that without that spark, you'll lose your sense of direction and identity. Can you tell me more about what you think would help you hold onto that sense of purpose and connection, even if live music events continue to be canceled? Are there other ways you've found to experience that feeling of being truly alive, or is it unique to live music for you?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>That's a great question. I think what's been helping me hold onto that sense of purpose and connection is my stamp collecting hobby. When I'm focused on sorting and categorizing my stamps, I can feel that same sense of immersion and connection to the activity. It's not the same as being in a concert crowd, but it's still a way for me to feel engaged and present. I've also been trying to connect with friends and family more, even if it's just a quick phone call or video chat. It's not the same as being in a live music setting, but it's still a way for me to feel connected to others.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Blake, it sounds like your stamp collecting hobby and efforts to connect with loved ones are ways for you to experience a sense of immersion and connection, even in the absence of live music events. It's beautiful that you're finding those alternatives. Can you tell me more about what draws you to stamp collecting? Is it the precision, the history, the tactile experience of handling the stamps, or something else entirely?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think it's a combination of things. I love the precision and attention to detail required for stamp collecting. It's almost meditative for me, and it helps me focus on something other than my worries. I also appreciate the history behind stamps – learning about the different countries, cultures, and events that have shaped their designs is fascinating to me. And, of course, there's the tactile experience of handling the stamps, feeling their texture, and smelling the paper they're printed on. It's like a sensory experience that helps me connect with the world in a different way. But, I think what really draws me to stamp collecting is the sense of accomplishment I get when I complete a set or find a rare stamp. It's like I'm collecting not just stamps, but memories and experiences.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like your stamp collecting hobby has become a source of comfort and connection for you, Blake. The precision and attention to detail required can be meditative, and the historical aspect adds a layer of depth and meaning. The tactile experience of handling the stamps is also a sensory delight. It's beautiful that you're finding ways to connect with the world and cultivate a sense of accomplishment through this hobby. Can you tell me more about what you think you would lose if you couldn't do stamp collecting anymore? Would it be the sense of accomplishment, the connection to history, or something else entirely?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>It's hard to imagine not being able to do stamp collecting anymore. I think I would miss the sense of accomplishment and the connection to history the most. I love learning about the different countries and cultures that have shaped the designs of the stamps, and I find it fascinating to see how they've evolved over time. But, I also think I would miss the meditative aspect of it, the feeling of being fully engaged and focused on the task at hand. It's like a little sanctuary for me, a way to escape from the worries and fears that plague me.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like the thought of not being able to do stamp collecting anymore is really distressing for you, Blake. The sense of accomplishment, connection to history, and meditative aspect of it have become important sources of comfort and meaning in your life. Can you tell me more about what you think would happen if you lost this source of comfort and meaning? Would it be like a part of you was missing, or would it be more like a shift in your perspective or priorities?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah, I think if I lost the ability to do stamp collecting, it would be like a part of me was missing. It's not just about the activity itself, but about the sense of accomplishment, the connection to history, and the meditative aspect that comes with it. It's like it's become a part of my identity, and without it, I would feel lost and disconnected.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Blake, it's clear that stamp collecting has become a significant source of comfort and meaning for you, and the thought of losing it is really distressing. It's as if you've found a way to connect with your sense of purpose and identity through this hobby, and that's what's making it so hard to imagine a life without it. Can you tell me more about what you think would happen if you were able to find other ways to tap into that same sense of comfort and meaning? Would you be open to exploring other activities or hobbies that could potentially fill that void, or do you think stamp collecting is a unique way for you to experience that sense of purpose and connection?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I'm not sure if I'm open to exploring other activities or hobbies that could potentially fill the void left by stamp collecting. I think it's because I've invested so much of myself in this hobby, and it's become such a significant part of my identity. But, at the same time, I don't want to be stuck in a rut and miss out on other experiences that could bring me joy and fulfillment. Maybe I could try other hobbies or activities that have similar elements to stamp collecting, like precision or attention to detail, and see if they resonate with me. It's just hard for me to imagine letting go of something that's been such a source of comfort and meaning for me.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're concerned that without stamp collecting, you'll lose a sense of purpose and connection to your identity. It's as if you've invested a lot of yourself in this hobby and it's become a significant part of who you are. Can you tell me more about what you think would happen if you were able to find other ways to tap into that same sense of comfort and meaning? Would you be open to exploring other activities or hobbies that could potentially fill that void, or do you think stamp collecting is a unique way for you to experience that sense of purpose and connection?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think I've been so focused on the idea of stamp collecting being a source of comfort and meaning that I haven't considered the possibility of finding other activities that could bring me the same sense of fulfillment. But, the more I think about it, the more I realize that there are other things that could potentially fill that void. Maybe I could try taking up a new hobby, like photography or painting, that requires precision and attention to detail. Or, I could try volunteering or helping out with a cause that I'm passionate about, which could bring a sense of purpose and connection to my life. It's just hard to imagine letting go of something that's been such a significant part of my identity, but at the same time, I don't want to be stuck in a rut and miss out on other experiences that could bring me joy and fulfillment.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Blake, it sounds like you're recognizing that there might be other ways to tap into that sense of comfort and meaning that you've found through stamp collecting. It's exciting that you're open to exploring new possibilities. I want to encourage you to take small steps towards discovering what those might be. Maybe we can brainstorm some ideas together, or I can help you set some goals for trying out new activities. What do you think?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think that's a great idea. I'm actually excited to explore new possibilities and see what other activities or hobbies could bring me a sense of fulfillment. It's just hard for me to imagine letting go of something that's been such a significant part of my identity, but at the same time, I don't want to be stuck in a rut and miss out on other experiences that could bring me joy and fulfillment.</div>

It's wonderful that you're recognizing that there are other ways to tap into that same feeling, and I'm here to support you in that process. Let's definitely brainstorm some ideas together and set some goals for trying out new activities. What are some things that you're passionate about or curious about that you haven't explored yet? Are there any hobbies or activities that you've always wanted to try but haven't had the chance?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think what's been holding me back from exploring new activities is the fear of not being able to find something that brings me the same sense of comfort and meaning as stamp collecting. But, talking to you has made me realize that it's okay to not have that figured out right away. It's like, I don't have to have the perfect hobby or activity that brings me the same sense of fulfillment as stamp collecting. I can just start exploring and see what works for me. And, who knows, maybe I'll find something that brings me even more joy and fulfillment than stamp collecting. It's scary to think about letting go of something that's been such a significant part of my identity, but I'm willing to take small steps towards discovering what might work for me. And, I think it would be helpful to have you as a support system to help me through this process.</div>

It's wonderful that you're recognizing that there are other ways to tap into that same feeling, and I'm here to support you in that process. I'd like to propose that we set a goal for you to try out a new activity or hobby every week for the next few weeks. This could be something as simple as trying a new recipe, taking a different route to work, or attempting a new craft. The goal is to keep an open mind and not put too much pressure on yourself to find the perfect activity. What do you think about that?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>That sounds like a great idea. I think it would be helpful to have a structured approach to exploring new activities and hobbies. Having a goal to try something new every week would give me a sense of direction and purpose.

I'm excited to see what I might discover and what might bring me a sense of comfort and meaning.</div>
