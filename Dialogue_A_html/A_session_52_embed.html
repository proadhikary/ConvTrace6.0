                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Hello, Gregory. I’m glad you’re here today. How are you feeling right now?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I've been trying to understand why my wife has been so distant. I think it all started around the time I lost my job. I feel like a failure and it's impacting our relationship.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>I'm so sorry to hear that you're going through this, Gregory. It sounds like you're feeling a lot of pain and frustration about the situation. Can you tell me more about what you mean by your wife being distant? How has her behavior changed, and how has it been affecting your relationship with her?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah, it's hard to explain, but I feel like she's withdrawn from me, you know? She used to initiate conversations and hang out with me, but now she just seems to be going through the motions. We used to have a lot of fun together, but lately, it's all just felt forced. When I try to talk to her about it, she just says I'm being paranoid and that she's fine. It's like she's not even listening to me.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>That sounds really tough, Gregory. It's like you're feeling unheard and neglected in your relationship. Can you help me understand what you think might be the underlying reasons for your wife's distance? Is there anything that's changed in your relationship since you lost your job that might be contributing to this change in her behavior?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think it's probably a combination of things. Losing my job was a huge blow to my ego, and I feel like I've been carrying that around with me. I've also been trying to find a new job, which has been stressful and made me feel like I'm not good enough. Maybe my wife is picking up on that and feeling like I'm not the same person she used to know. Plus, we've been having a lot of financial stress lately, and that's put a lot of pressure on our relationship.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're feeling like you're carrying a lot of weight on your shoulders, both literally and figuratively, since you lost your job. You're not only dealing with the practical challenges of finding a new job, but also the emotional toll of feeling like a failure. And on top of that, you're experiencing financial stress, which can be really overwhelming. It's no wonder you're feeling like you're not the same person your wife used to know. Has your wife ever shared with you how she's feeling, or is everything kind of one-sided in terms of communication about this?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah, it's like she's not really communicating with me about it. When I try to talk to her, she just tells me I'm being paranoid and that everything is fine. It's like she's not even willing to listen to me or acknowledge my feelings.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're feeling really frustrated and unheard in your relationship, and that's really tough. It's like you're trying to reach out and connect with your wife, but she's not responding or acknowledging your feelings. That can be really isolating and lonely. Can you tell me more about what you think might be behind her resistance to talking about this? Is there anything specific you think might be making her shut down or avoid the conversation?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah, I think she's probably feeling overwhelmed and stressed too, and maybe she's not sure how to deal with it. I know I've been bringing a lot of negative emotions into our relationship, and maybe she's just trying to cope with that by distancing herself. But it's hard for me to understand why she can't just talk to me about it and work through this together.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're feeling really hurt and confused by your wife's distance, and you're struggling to understand why she's not willing to talk to you about it. It's like you're feeling isolated and alone in your relationship, and that can be really painful. I want to acknowledge that it takes a lot of courage to come to therapy and talk about these feelings, and I appreciate your vulnerability. Can we explore the idea that your wife's distance might be a way of coping with her own feelings of overwhelm and stress? Maybe she's not sure how to deal with the emotions that come with being married to someone who's going through a tough time, and she's using distance as a way to protect herself. Does that make sense to you, or is there another explanation that you're considering?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>That makes sense, I guess. It's hard to imagine my wife feeling overwhelmed and stressed, but I can see how that would make sense. Maybe she's just trying to find a way to cope with the situation, even if it feels like she's abandoning me. But it's still really tough for me to understand why she can't just talk to me about it and work through this together. I feel like we're not communicating at all, and it's like we're just existing in the same space without really connecting with each other.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Can you help me understand what you mean by existing in the same space without connecting with each other? What does that look like, and how does it make you feel?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah, it's like we're just going through the motions. We're having conversations, but they feel superficial and don't really go anywhere. We're not really connecting on a deep level, and it feels like we're just two separate people living together. It's like we're not really listening to each other, and when we do try to talk about something, it always ends in an argument or a misunderstanding. It's really lonely and isolating, and it feels like we're losing our connection as a couple.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're feeling a deep sense of disconnection and loneliness in your relationship with your wife. You're describing a sense of going through the motions, having superficial conversations that don't feel meaningful or connected. You're also saying that when you do try to talk about something, it always ends in an argument or misunderstanding. Can you help me understand what you think might be missing from your conversations with your wife? What do you think would need to happen for you to feel more connected and understood in your relationship?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah, it's like we're not really communicating on a deeper level. We're not sharing our feelings and thoughts with each other, and that's leaving a void in our relationship. I think we need to start having more meaningful conversations, where we really listen to each other and try to understand each other's perspectives. We need to be more vulnerable and open with each other, and not be afraid to show our emotions.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're longing for a deeper sense of connection and understanding with your wife. You're craving meaningful conversations that allow you to share your feelings and thoughts, and to really hear each other's perspectives. It's like you're wanting to break through the surface-level conversations and get to a place where you can be more vulnerable and open with each other. Can you imagine what that might look like, or what kind of conversations you'd like to have with your wife to feel more connected and understood?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think what would help me feel more connected and understood is if we could have more regular, meaningful conversations about how we're both feeling. Maybe we could set aside some time each week to really talk about our thoughts, feelings, and concerns with each other, without interruption or judgment. That way, we could feel like we're really listening to and understanding each other, and not just going through the motions.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're really craving a deeper sense of connection and understanding with your wife, and that you're willing to do the work to get there. I love the idea of setting aside dedicated time to have meaningful conversations with each other. That can be a really powerful way to build intimacy and connection in a relationship. Have you talked to your wife about this idea before, or is this something you're considering proposing to her?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah, I've tried to bring it up with her a few times, but it always ends in an argument. She says I'm being too needy or clingy, and that we don't need to have all these deep conversations. I feel like I'm just trying to connect with her and understand her, but she shuts me down every time. It's really frustrating and discouraging. I'm not sure what to do or how to make it work.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're really struggling to connect with your wife and feel understood in your relationship.

                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think that makes sense, but it's still really hard for me to understand why she can't just talk to me about it and work through this together. I feel like we're just stuck in this pattern of not communicating and not listening to each other, and it's really draining and lonely. I wish I could find a way to break through and get her to open up to me again.</div>

I love the idea of setting aside dedicated time to have meaningful conversations with each other. That can be a really powerful way to build intimacy and connection in a relationship. Would you be open to exploring some strategies for having these kinds of conversations, and maybe even practicing some role-playing exercises to help you feel more comfortable and confident in expressing your feelings and needs to your wife?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think that's a great idea, counselor. I would definitely be open to exploring some strategies for having more meaningful conversations with my wife. I feel like we've been stuck in this pattern of not communicating and not listening to each other for a while now, and I'm not sure how to break through it. I'm willing to do whatever it takes to improve our relationship and feel more connected and understood. Can we start by practicing some role-playing exercises to help me feel more comfortable and confident in expressing my feelings and needs to my wife? Maybe we can even practice having some of these conversations without actually talking to my wife, just to get a sense of what it might be like.</div>

It's as if you're recognizing that her distance is not just a reaction to your own struggles, but also a coping mechanism for her own feelings of overwhelm. It's a really important step to take, acknowledging that your partner's emotions and needs are valid and not just a reflection of your own.</div>
