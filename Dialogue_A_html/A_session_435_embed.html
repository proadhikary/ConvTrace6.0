                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Hi Justin, thanks for coming in today. What brings you to counseling?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I've been feeling a lot of distress at work lately. I believe my boss doesn't like me, and it's really affecting my performance and well-being.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Can you tell me more about what makes you feel like your boss doesn't like you? Is there a specific incident or conversation that led you to feel this way?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yes, there was a particular incident where my boss gave me some constructive feedback on my performance. I felt like he was being overly critical and that it was a personal attack on me. I've been replaying that conversation in my head, and every time I interact with him, I feel like he's looking down on me.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Can you help me understand what specifically about that feedback felt like a personal attack to you? Was it the tone, the words used, or something else entirely?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think it's a combination of everything. The tone was quite stern, and the words he used were very specific and pointed. He mentioned that I was not meeting the expectations of the team, and that my work was subpar. I felt like he was singling me out and making me feel inferior.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like the feedback really resonated with you and made you feel like you're not good enough. Can you help me understand what's going through your mind when you replay that conversation in your head? What are some of the thoughts that come up for you?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah, I can definitely see how my mind is playing tricks on me, making me feel like I'm not good enough. I think what's going through my mind is, Justin, you're not capable of doing your job, you're not good enough, and your boss is just waiting for you to fail.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're having a lot of negative self-talk and self-doubt going on. It's like your mind is replaying the conversation and coming up with all these negative conclusions about yourself. Can you help me understand what you think is driving this self-doubt? Is it something that's been going on for a while, or is it a new development?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>That's a good point, I never really thought about it that way. I think it's a combination of both, it's been going on for a while, but it's definitely gotten worse since that incident. I've been trying to prove myself to my boss and colleagues by overworking and seeking constant validation, but it's not working because I'm still feeling like I'm not good enough.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're experiencing a lot of self-doubt and negative self-talk, and it's been building up over time. But the incident with your boss definitely triggered a lot of negative thoughts and feelings. Can you help me understand what you mean by trying to prove yourself to your boss and colleagues? What are you hoping to achieve by overworking and seeking validation?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>That's a great question. I think I'm trying to prove to myself that I'm capable and competent, that I'm not just making mistakes and failing. I'm trying to show my boss and colleagues that I'm a valuable member of the team, that my work is important and worth recognizing. But the more I try to prove myself, the more I feel like I'm not good enough, and that's just perpetuating this cycle of self-doubt and negative thoughts.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're caught in a bit of a vicious cycle, where you're trying to prove yourself to others, but in doing so, you're actually reinforcing these negative thoughts and feelings about yourself. Can you help me understand what you think would happen if you were to stop trying to prove yourself and just focus on doing your job to the best of your ability, without seeking constant validation from others?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>That's a really interesting point, and it's something I've been struggling with for a while now. I think if I were to stop trying to prove myself and just focus on doing my job to the best of my ability, I would feel a sense of relief and freedom. I would no longer be tied down by these negative thoughts and feelings of inadequacy, and I would be able to approach my work with a sense of confidence and competence.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're carrying a heavy burden of self-doubt and negative self-talk, and it's affecting your performance and well-being. It's understandable that you're trying to prove yourself to others, but it's important to recognize that true validation comes from within. When you focus on external validation, it can create a sense of dependence on others' approval, which can be unstable and unpredictable. By focusing on doing your job to the best of your ability, without seeking constant validation, you may find that you're able to tap into a deeper sense of confidence and competence. Can you help me explore what that might look like for you? What would be some specific steps you could take to shift your focus from seeking validation to focusing on your work?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think one step I could take is to start setting realistic goals for myself at work and focusing on achieving those goals, rather than constantly seeking validation from others. Maybe I could start by identifying one or two areas where I feel like I'm struggling and then work on improving those skills. Additionally, I could try to reframe my thinking by focusing on what I'm doing well, rather than dwelling on my perceived shortcomings. For example, I could make a mental note of the times when my boss or colleagues have complimented me on my work or acknowledged my contributions to the team.</div>

                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think I can see how my negative thoughts and self-doubt are linked to my need for external validation. I've been so focused on proving myself to others that I haven't stopped to think about what I'm actually capable of. It's like I've been walking around with this heavy weight of self-doubt, and it's been holding me back from being my best self.</div>

                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think it's interesting that you're saying that true validation comes from within. It makes sense, because when I'm focused on external validation, I do feel like I'm constantly seeking approval from others, and that can be really stressful and anxiety-provoking. Maybe setting those realistic goals and focusing on my work will help me feel more confident and competent, and that in turn will help me feel more self-assured and less dependent on others' approval. I'd like to explore this idea further and see how I can apply it to my daily life at work.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're really starting to connect the dots between your negative thoughts, self-doubt, and need for external validation. You're recognizing that when you focus on external validation, you feel stressed and anxiety-provoked, and that's a really important insight. Can you help me understand what would happen if you were to focus on acknowledging and accepting your own strengths and abilities, rather than constantly seeking validation from others? How might that impact your sense of confidence and self-assurance?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I can see how focusing on acknowledging and accepting my own strengths and abilities could help me build confidence and self-assurance. It's like I've been so focused on my perceived shortcomings and weaknesses that I haven't stopped to think about my strengths and accomplishments. By acknowledging and accepting my own abilities, I might be able to shift my focus from seeking external validation to recognizing my own value and worth. That would be a huge relief, and I think it would help me approach my work with more confidence and competence.</div>

But now, I feel like I'm starting to see a glimmer of hope. I realize that I don't have to rely on external validation to feel confident and competent, and that by focusing on my own abilities and strengths, I can build a sense of self-assurance that's not dependent on others. It's a big shift for me, but I think it's a necessary one if I want to break free from this cycle of self-doubt and negativity.</div>
