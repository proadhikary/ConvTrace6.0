                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Hello Gregory, thank you for coming in today. How can I help you?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I just don't get why I can't seem to accept that I can't fix this. It's not like I haven't tried everything.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're feeling really frustrated and stuck, and like you're beating yourself up over not being able to fix something. Can you tell me more about what's going on and what you mean by this? What is it that you're trying to fix?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah, I guess I'm just feeling really helpless and like I'm not doing enough to help my wife. It's like, no matter what I do, nothing seems to work, and it's like I'm just standing still while she's getting further and further behind. It's really hard for me to accept that there's nothing more I can do, and it's like, I feel like I'm just sitting here, watching her struggle, and there's nothing I can do to stop it.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>That sounds incredibly painful and isolating. It sounds like you're carrying a huge burden of responsibility and feeling like you're not meeting your own expectations. It's like you're saying to yourself, I should be able to fix this, I should be able to make it better. Can you tell me more about what's going on with your wife and what's causing her to be struggling? Is there any sense of what might be contributing to her struggles, or is it just a sense of feeling stuck and helpless?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah, I don't know... I just feel like I'm running out of options, you know? I've tried every treatment, every therapy, every alternative method... nothing seems to work. And it's not just that, it's like, my brother-in-law, he's always talking about his success, and it's like, a constant reminder that I'm not good enough.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like there's a lot of pressure and comparison going on, not just with your wife's struggles, but also with your brother-in-law's perceived success. It's like you're constantly being reminded of what you're not doing well enough. Can you tell me more about what it's like to be around your brother-in-law and how that affects you?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>It's like, I feel like I'm in this constant competition with him, even though I know it's not fair. I feel like I'm always one step behind, and it's like, no matter how hard I try, I can't catch up. And it's not just that, it's like, my wife is always looking to him for guidance and support, and it's like, I feel like I'm not good enough for her.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're experiencing a lot of self-doubt and feelings of inadequacy, not just in relation to your wife's struggles, but also in comparison to your brother-in-law's perceived success. It's like you're constantly feeling like you're not measuring up. Can you tell me more about what you think your brother-in-law's success is based on? Is it his accomplishments, his personality, something else? And how do you think his success is influencing your feelings of self-worth?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>It's like, I don't know, maybe he's just naturally good at everything he does, and I'm just not. But at the same time, it's hard for me to accept that I'm not good enough, no matter how hard I try. It's like, I keep thinking that if I just try harder, I'll be able to catch up, but it's like, no matter what I do, I always feel like I'm falling short.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're putting a lot of pressure on yourself to be perfect and to meet certain expectations, not just in terms of helping your wife, but also in comparison to your brother-in-law's perceived success. It's like you're constantly striving for something that feels unattainable, and that's leading to feelings of inadequacy and self-doubt. Can you tell me more about what you think would happen if you were to accept that you're not good enough, and that there are some things that are just outside of your control? What would that feel like for you, and what do you think would be the potential benefits of letting go of this need to be perfect?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I don't know, it's hard for me to even imagine accepting that I'm not good enough. It feels like giving up, like I'm admitting defeat. And what would that say about me as a person? That I'm not capable of doing something that's important to me? That's just too hard for me to swallow.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like accepting your limitations and imperfections feels like a threat to your sense of identity and self-worth. You're worried that if you don't measure up to your own expectations and your brother-in-law's perceived success, you'll be seen as inadequate or incapable. Can you explore with me what it would mean to redefine what it means to be a good person or a good partner, not in terms of your achievements or abilities, but in terms of your values and intentions? What would be the benefits of shifting your focus from trying to be perfect to being present and supportive in your relationships, even when you're not able to fix everything?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I guess what's hard for me to accept is that I'm not the one who's supposed to fix everything in my life. I've always been the one who takes care of things, who makes things happen, and it's hard for me to let go of that sense of control. But at the same time, I realize that I can't do it all alone, and that my wife needs support and help from other people too. It's hard for me to accept that I'm not the only one who can help her, and that she needs to rely on others too.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're struggling with a deep-seated sense of responsibility and control, and that it's hard for you to accept that there are limits to what you can do for your wife. It's like you're holding onto the idea that you're the only one who can fix everything, and that if you let go of that control, you'll be failing as a partner. Can you explore with me what it would mean to redefine your role in your relationship, not as the sole problem-solver, but as a supportive partner who can work alongside others to help your wife? What would it feel like to let go of that need for control and trust that others can also contribute to your wife's well-being?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think I'm starting to understand what you're getting at. It's like, I've been so focused on trying to fix everything that I've forgotten what it means to be a good partner, to be supportive and present. And it's hard for me to accept that I'm not the only one who can help my wife, that she needs to rely on others too. But at the same time, I realize that if I can let go of that need for control and trust that others can also contribute to her well-being, I might be able to find some peace and acceptance.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're beginning to see that your need for control and perfection is actually getting in the way of being a good partner and supporting your wife. Can you explore with me what it would mean to let go of that need for control and trust that others can also contribute to your wife's well-being? What would it feel like to focus on being present and supportive, rather than trying to fix everything?</div>
