                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Good afternoon, Karen. How are you feeling today?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I'm feeling a bit anxious about my future, especially with my career change. I'm worried that no casino will hire me because of my age.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>I can sense that you're feeling quite anxious about this career change and the impact of your age on your job prospects. Can you tell me more about what's driving these worries? Is there a specific experience or concern that's making you feel this way?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Honestly, I'm worried that people will judge me based on my age, and that I won't be taken seriously or considered for the position because of it. It's like I'm competing with younger, more energetic candidates who have a fresh perspective, and I'm worried that my age will be a liability.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're worried about being judged and not being taken seriously because of your age, and that's causing you a lot of anxiety. Can you help me understand what you mean by 'people will judge me'? Is it specifically employees at the casino, or is it more about you feeling like you're not up to par with the industry standards?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>It's not just the employees, it's the whole industry. I feel like everyone in the industry has a certain image of what a casino manager should be, and that's someone young and energetic. I'm worried that I won't be able to fit that mold, and that it will affect my ability to do the job effectively.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're worried that your age will affect not only how others perceive you but also your ability to perform in the role. You're concerned that people will assume you're not up to par with the industry standards because of your age. Can you help me understand what specific aspects of the job you're worried about not being able to do as well as someone younger? Is it the physical demands, the need for energy and stamina, or something else entirely?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>It's not just the physical demands or energy, but I think it's more about my ability to understand and connect with the younger generation. I'm worried that my age will make it difficult for me to relate to the customers, or to understand the latest trends and technologies in the industry. I feel like I'll be stuck in the past and won't be able to keep up with the pace of the industry.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're worried that your age will affect your ability to connect with the younger generation and understand the latest trends and technologies in the industry, which is making you feel anxious about your ability to be effective in the role. Can you tell me more about what specifically is making you feel like you'll be stuck in the past? Is it a fear of being out of touch with the latest developments, or is it more about feeling like you won't be able to adapt to change?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think it's a bit of both. I'm worried that I won't be able to keep up with the latest developments and technologies, and that I'll be seen as out of touch. But at the same time, I'm also worried that I won't be able to adapt to change and will be stuck in my ways. It's like I'm worried that I'll be unable to evolve and grow with the industry, and that will hold me back from being successful.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're worried about being seen as out of touch and unable to adapt to change, which is causing you a lot of anxiety about your ability to be successful in this new career. Can you help me understand what specific changes or developments in the industry are making you feel like you won't be able to keep up? Is it the rise of online gambling, changes in gaming laws, or something else entirely?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think it's the combination of online gambling and the increasing use of technology in casinos that's making me feel like I won't be able to keep up. It's like I'm worried that I won't be able to understand how to use the new systems and software, and that I'll be seen as old-fashioned and outdated.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like the industry's shift towards online gambling and technology is causing you a lot of concern about being able to adapt and keep up. It's not just about being able to use the new systems and software, but also about being able to understand and connect with the younger generation who are more familiar with these technologies. Can you help me understand what specific skills or knowledge you're worried you're missing out on? Is it a fear of not being able to learn new things, or is it more about feeling like you won't be able to catch up with the pace of change?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think it's a bit of both. I'm worried that I won't be able to learn new things quickly enough, and that I'll be seen as slow to adapt. But at the same time, I'm also worried that I won't be able to use my existing knowledge and experience to my advantage, and that I'll be stuck in the past. It's like I'm worried that I'll be unable to leverage my strengths and skills to succeed in this new role.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're worried about being able to adapt to the changing industry and being seen as out of touch, which is causing you a lot of anxiety about your ability to be successful in this new career. Can you help me understand what specific strengths and skills you think you bring to the table that might be overlooked or undervalued because of your age?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think about my years of experience in statistics and how I've developed strong analytical skills, which could be valuable in a casino management role. I've also had experience working with people from different backgrounds and cultures, which could help me connect with the diverse customer base in a casino.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're worried that your age will affect not only how others perceive you but also your ability to perform in the role. You're concerned that people will assume you're not up to par with the industry standards because of your age. It's important to recognize that your years of experience and strong analytical skills could be a significant asset in a casino management role. Can you help me understand why you're not recognizing these strengths and skills as valuable in this new career?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think I'm so focused on the negative aspects of my age that I'm overlooking my own strengths and skills. Maybe I'm being too hard on myself and expecting others to have the same biases and stereotypes about age.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're being very critical of yourself and assuming that others will have the same negative perceptions about your age. It's understandable to feel that way, but I want to encourage you to take a step back and recognize the value you bring to the table. Your years of experience and strong analytical skills are significant assets that could benefit a casino management role. Can you help me understand what's driving this self-criticism and negative self-talk about your age? Is it a fear of being rejected or not being good enough, or is it something else entirely?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think I've been focusing so much on the negative aspects of my age that I've lost sight of my own strengths and skills. Maybe I'm being too hard on myself and expecting others to have the same biases and stereotypes about age. I need to work on changing my own mindset and recognizing my value as a candidate, regardless of my age.</div>

                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think that if I were to let go of these negative thoughts and self-criticism, I would feel more confident and self-assured.
