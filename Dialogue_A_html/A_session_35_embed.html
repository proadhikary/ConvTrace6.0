                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Hi Trent, Iâ€™m glad you could make it today. How are you feeling right now as we start our session?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I'm feeling a bit anxious, like I mentioned. It's just hard to open up about these things, especially since I've been dealing with it for so long.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Can you tell me more about what's been going on for you and what exactly is making you feel anxious about sharing it with me? Sometimes just acknowledging what's hard to talk about can help us start to break it down and make it more manageable.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah, I guess it's just hard for me to open up because I feel like I'm not good enough or that people won't understand me. It's like I'm stuck in this perpetual cycle of self-doubt and it's hard to shake off.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>I sense that there's a lot of self-criticism going on, and that's really tough. It sounds like you're carrying around a lot of negative self-talk, and that can be really exhausting. Would you be willing to explore with me where this sense of not being good enough comes from? Is there a specific incident or experience that stands out to you, or is it more of a general feeling that's been building over time?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah, I think it started from a pretty young age, maybe around middle school or high school. I was always a bit of a perfectionist, and I put a lot of pressure on myself to do well academically and socially. When I didn't meet my own expectations, I'd beat myself up over it and tell myself I'm just not good enough. It's been a constant companion ever since, and it's hard to shake off.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Ah, I see. So it sounds like this sense of not being good enough has been a long-standing issue for you, and it's been fueled by your own high expectations and self-criticism. It's amazing how we can be so hard on ourselves, isn't it? Can you help me understand what's been the most hurtful or damaging part of this self-criticism for you? Has it affected other areas of your life, like relationships or work, or is it more of an internal struggle?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah, it's definitely affected my relationships and social life. I have a hard time connecting with people because I'm always worried about saying or doing something wrong, and I feel like I'm not good enough to be around others. It's like I'm stuck in this perpetual cycle of self-doubt, and it's hard to break free from it.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>I can sense how isolating this must feel for you, Trent. It's like you're carrying around this heavy burden of self-doubt, and it's affecting your ability to form meaningful connections with others. I want to acknowledge that it takes a lot of courage to admit this, and I'm here to support you in exploring ways to break free from this cycle. Can you tell me more about what you mean by 'saying or doing something wrong'? Is there a specific fear or worry that's driving this anxiety for you?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah, I'm scared that if I say or do something wrong, people will see me as incompetent or inadequate, and that would just reinforce my belief that I'm not good enough. It's like I'm always walking on eggshells, trying not to make a mistake, and it's exhausting.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're concerned about being judged or found wanting by others, and that's causing a lot of anxiety for you. I want to gently challenge that thought - what if, just for a moment, you could let go of the fear of being judged and focus on being present and authentic in your interactions with others? Can you imagine what that would feel like, to be able to be yourself without the weight of self-doubt holding you back?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah, I think I can try that. It's hard for me to imagine letting go of the fear of being judged, but if it means being more authentic and connecting with others, I'm willing to give it a shot. It's just scary to think about being vulnerable and opening myself up to potential criticism or rejection.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>I completely understand, Trent. It's natural to feel scared about being vulnerable and open to potential criticism or rejection. But I want to gently remind you that vulnerability is often the precursor to deep connection and intimacy. And I'm here to support you in that process. Can you help me understand what would happen if you were to take that first step and be more authentic and vulnerable with someone? What do you think would be the worst-case scenario, and what do you think would be the best-case scenario?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah, I think I can try that. It's hard for me to imagine letting go of the fear of being judged, but if it means being more authentic and connecting with others, I'm willing to give it a shot. It's just scary to think about being vulnerable and opening myself up to potential criticism or rejection.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Can you help me understand what's been the most rewarding or fulfilling experience you've had when you have been more authentic and vulnerable with someone? Was there a particular person or situation where you felt like you were able to be yourself without judgment or criticism?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah, I think one of the most rewarding experiences I've had was with a close friend from college. We were going through a tough time, and I was feeling really overwhelmed and anxious. I opened up to him about my struggles, and he was incredibly supportive and understanding. He didn't judge me or try to fix everything; he just listened and offered words of encouragement. It was a really powerful experience for me, and it made me realize that being vulnerable and authentic with someone can lead to deep connection and understanding.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Ah, I'm so glad you shared that experience with me, Trent. It's beautiful to see how being vulnerable and authentic with someone can lead to deep connection and understanding. It sounds like your friend was able to create a safe space for you to open up and be yourself without judgment. Can you help me understand what you think he did differently that made you feel so supported and understood? Was it something specific he said or did, or was it more about the way he listened to you?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>It was a combination of both, I think. He listened to me with empathy and understanding, and he didn't try to offer solutions or fix everything. He just let me know that he was there for me and that I wasn't alone. He also validated my feelings and acknowledged that it's okay to feel overwhelmed and anxious sometimes. It was a really powerful experience for me, and it made me realize that being vulnerable and authentic with someone can lead to deep connection and understanding.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you've had some really meaningful experiences with your friend from college, and it's wonderful that you felt seen and understood by him. It's clear that he created a safe space for you to open up and be yourself without judgment. I'm curious, what do you think it is about his approach that allowed you to feel so supported and understood? Was it something specific he said or did, or was it more about the way he listened to you? And how do you think his approach differs from the way you often interact with others, where you feel like you're walking on eggshells and trying not to make a mistake?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah, I think it's a combination of both, like I said.

                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah, I think it's the way he listened to me without judgment, without trying to fix everything, and without offering unsolicited advice. It was like he was really present with me, and that made me feel seen and heard in a way that I rarely feel with others.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're describing a really special kind of connection with your friend from college. It's clear that he created a safe space for you to be yourself, without judgment or criticism. I'm curious, have you noticed any patterns or commonalities in the way he interacted with you that allowed you to feel so supported and understood? For example, was there a specific tone or attitude he used, or was it more about the way he responded to what you were saying?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think it's interesting that you're pointing out the pattern of my friend's behavior, because it makes me realize that I've been craving that kind of connection and understanding with others. It's like I've been searching for someone who can see me for who I am, without judgment, and offer me a sense of safety and validation. Maybe that's what I've been missing all along, and maybe that's what I need to work on in my relationships.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you've had a profound realization, Trent. It seems like you've been craving a sense of connection and understanding with others, and you've been searching for someone who can see you for who you are, without judgment. This is a really powerful insight, and I'm curious to explore this further with you. Can you help me understand what you think would happen if you were to cultivate more of that kind of connection and understanding in your relationships? What do you think would change for you, and how do you think it would impact your sense of self and your relationships with others?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think it would make a huge difference in my relationships and my sense of self. If I could feel more connected and understood by others, I would feel more confident and less anxious about being myself. I would be able to be more authentic and vulnerable, and I think that would lead to deeper and more meaningful connections with others. I would feel like I'm not alone and that I'm seen and heard by others, which would be incredibly freeing and empowering.</div>
