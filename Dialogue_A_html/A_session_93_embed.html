                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Hi Blake, it's nice to meet you. Let's start by discussing why you decided to come in for counseling today.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I just can't stop thinking about it. Every time I try to focus on something else, my mind goes back to the idea that all the concerts I look forward to are going to get canceled. It's really overwhelming.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>I can sense the distress and anxiety in your voice, Blake. It sounds like the thought of concerts getting canceled is really weighing on your mind. Can you tell me more about what's behind this concern? Is there something specific that's making you worry about the concerts being canceled?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I don't know, it just feels like everything is being taken away from me. I've been looking forward to those concerts for months, and now it's like they're just going to disappear. I feel like I'm losing control of everything.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Blake, it sounds like this cancellation is not just about the concerts themselves, but about the sense of control and stability you're experiencing. It's like you're feeling like everything is being taken away from you, and that can be really frightening. Can you help me understand what kind of control or stability you're feeling like you've lost in your life? Is there something specific that's changed or shifted that's making you feel like you're losing your footing?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>It's like, everything feels so out of control. My mom is always on my case about something, and I feel like I'm just stuck in this rut. I've been trying to focus on my stamp collecting, but even that feels like a chore now. And on top of that, there's all this uncertainty about the concerts. It's like, what's the point of even trying if everything is just going to get canceled anyway?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Blake, it sounds like you're feeling like you're stuck in a cycle of feeling overwhelmed and powerless. It's like you're trying to hold on to things that bring you joy, like stamp collecting, but even that feels like a struggle right now. Can you help me understand what's going on with your mom? Is there something specific that's causing the stress and tension between you two? And how do you think this uncertainty about the concerts is impacting your daily life and sense of purpose?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>It's like, I don't even know how to explain it. My mom is always nagging me about something, and it feels like she's just trying to control me all the time. And then there's the uncertainty about the concerts, and it's like, what's the point of even trying if everything is just going to get canceled anyway? I feel like I'm just stuck in this rut, and I don't know how to get out of it.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Blake, it sounds like your mom's behavior is really affecting your sense of autonomy and freedom. It's like you're feeling trapped and unable to make your own decisions. And on top of that, the uncertainty about the concerts is adding to your feelings of powerlessness. I want you to know that it's normal to feel this way, and it's okay to acknowledge those feelings. Can you help me understand what you think would need to happen for you to feel like you're in control again? Is there something specific that you wish your mom would do differently, or something you wish you could do differently in response to her behavior?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I don't know, it's like... I just feel like I'm stuck in this rut and I don't know how to get out of it. Every time I try to do something I enjoy, like collecting stamps, it feels like a chore because I'm constantly worrying about the concerts getting canceled. And my mom is always on my case about something, it feels like she's just trying to control me all the time. I feel like I'm just losing my sense of purpose and freedom.</div>

                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>It's hard for me to even think about what I could do differently, because it feels like everything is just being taken away from me. I feel like I'm just trying to hold on to what's left, but it's like sand slipping through my fingers. I don't know how to make my mom stop controlling me, and I don't know how to stop worrying about the concerts getting canceled. It all feels so overwhelming.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Blake, it sounds like you're feeling like you're drowning in a sea of uncertainty and control.

                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I guess I feel like I'm just stuck in this rut and I don't know how to get out of it. I've been trying to distract myself with other things, like watching TV or playing video games, but nothing seems to work. I just can't shake off the feeling that everything is being taken away from me.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Blake, it's like you're feeling completely stuck and unsure of how to move forward. It's like you're caught in a cycle of feeling overwhelmed and powerless, and you're struggling to find a sense of control and freedom. I want to acknowledge that it can be really frustrating and demoralizing to feel like you're trying to hold on to things that bring you joy, but they feel like they're slipping away from you. Can we explore what small steps you might be able to take to start breaking free from this feeling of being stuck? Is there something you've always wanted to try, or something that brings you a sense of comfort, that you could try to focus on right now?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>It's hard for me to even think about small steps because everything feels like it's too big, too overwhelming. I just want to feel like I'm in control of something, anything, in my life. Maybe if I could just talk to my mom about how I'm feeling, maybe she could understand where I'm coming from. But even that feels like a big ask, because I'm not sure she'd even listen.</div>

Can we try to focus on one thing at a time, rather than feeling like we need to tackle everything all at once?
