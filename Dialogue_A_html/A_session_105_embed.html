                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Hi Livia, welcome. How are you feeling about being here today?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I guess I'm feeling a bit skeptical. I've tried things like keeping a gratitude journal, but nothing really seems to help. What if this just ends up being another thing that doesn't work?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>I completely understand your skepticism, Livia. It's natural to feel that way, especially when we've tried different approaches before and haven't seen the results we were hoping for. Can you tell me more about what led you to decide that counseling might be a good next step for you? What's been going on in your life that's been causing you to feel like you need some support?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I don't know...I just feel like everything is always going wrong, and no matter how hard I try to focus on the good things, it's like they're just not there. It's like I'm stuck in this never-ending cycle of negativity, and I don't know how to get out of it.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're feeling really stuck and overwhelmed, and that's a really tough place to be. Can you help me understand more about what you mean by everything is always going wrong? Are there specific things that are happening in your life that are causing you to feel this way, or is it more of a general feeling?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>It's just...I don't know, everything feels like it's falling apart. My relationships are strained because I'm always focusing on the negative, my job is unfulfilling, and even the small things like going for a walk or cooking a meal feel like they're a chore. It's like I'm just going through the motions, and I don't know how to shake this feeling that I'm just stuck in this rut.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Can you help me understand what you mean by going through the motions? What does that feel like for you, and how do you think it's affecting your daily life and relationships?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah, I mean, I just feel like I'm just doing things because I have to, not because I actually want to. It's like I'm just a robot going through all these motions, and I don't have any sense of purpose or fulfillment. And it's affecting everything, even my relationships, because I'm just so focused on the negatives that I'm pushing people away.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>That sounds really tough, Livia. It's like you're feeling disconnected from yourself and others, and that can be a really isolating experience. Can you help me understand what you think might be the root of this feeling of being just a robot going through the motions? Is there something specific that you think triggered this sense of disconnection, or is it more of a gradual process that's been building up over time?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>It's hard for me to pinpoint a specific trigger, but I think it might be connected to this difficult life event from a few years ago. I've always been someone who tries to focus on the positives, but after that event, it's like I just couldn't shake this feeling of negativity. It's like I was searching for something to hold onto, and even when things seemed good, I just couldn't trust that they would last.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Livia, it sounds like that difficult life event has had a profound impact on your life and has led to this sense of disconnection and negativity. It's like you're carrying a heavy burden from that experience and it's affecting your daily life and relationships. Can you help me understand more about what happened during that event and how you've been carrying it with you since then? How have you been trying to cope with the aftermath of it?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>It's just so hard to even think about it without feeling overwhelmed and anxious. I don't know how to put it into words, but it was like my whole world was turned upside down. I felt like I was losing control and couldn't do anything to stop it. Even talking about it now is making me feel like I'm going to break down. Maybe it's just too much to deal with, and I don't know if I'm ready to face it.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>I can sense how overwhelming this experience has been for you, Livia. It takes a lot of courage to even mention it, and I'm here to support you as you explore this difficult chapter in your life. It's okay to feel overwhelmed and anxious, and I want you to know that you're not alone in this. Sometimes, just acknowledging the pain and difficulty of an experience can be a big step, and I'm here to help you take that step. Would you be willing to explore this experience with me a bit further? Maybe we can start by breaking it down into smaller, more manageable pieces, or by exploring what you've been doing to cope with the aftermath. I want you to know that I'm here to listen and support you, and we can take things at your pace.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>It's just that every time I try to think about it, I feel like I'm going to break down. I don't know how to put it into words, and I'm scared that if I start talking about it, I'll just get overwhelmed and won't be able to stop. I feel like I'm stuck in this cycle of negative thinking, and I don't know how to get out of it.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're feeling really anxious about revisiting this difficult experience, and that's completely understandable. It's like you're holding your breath, waiting for the other shoe to drop, and that can be a really scary place to be. Can you help me understand what you think would happen if you were to start talking about this experience? What are you worried would happen if you were to let your guard down and allow yourself to feel the emotions that are tied up with it?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think if I were to start talking about it, I'd feel like I'm opening up a can of worms. I'd be worried that if I let my guard down, I'd get overwhelmed and won't be able to stop feeling that way. I'd be scared that I'd fall apart and won't be able to put the pieces back together again. It's like I'm afraid of losing control all over again.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're feeling a lot of fear and anxiety around revisiting this difficult experience, and that's really understandable. It's like you're worried that if you start talking about it, you'll lose control and won't be able to stop feeling overwhelmed. Can you help me understand what you think would happen if you were to start talking about this experience with me, and I promise to be here to support you every step of the way?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>It's hard for me to even imagine being able to talk about it without feeling like I'm going to break down. I guess part of me is scared that if I start to open up, I'll just get lost in all the emotions and feelings and won't be able to find my way back out. But at the same time, I feel like I need to face this and try to work through it, even if it's really hard. I just don't know how to do it.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Livia, it sounds like you're carrying a lot of fear and anxiety around revisiting this difficult experience, and I want you to know that I'm here to support you every step of the way.

                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I'm not sure, I feel like I'm just stuck in this rut and I don't know how to get out of it. I've tried talking to friends and family, but they don't really understand what I'm going through. I feel like I'm just a burden to them, and that's why I'm here, I guess. I don't know if counseling can really help me, but I'm willing to try.</div>
