                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Hi Jonathan, it's nice to meet you. How are you feeling about being here today?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I'm feeling a bit anxious, but I’m also hopeful. I’ve been dealing with these feelings of self-doubt and stagnation in my career and I want to find a way to change that.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Can you tell me more about what's been going on in your career that's making you feel stagnant and uncertain? What are some specific situations or events that have contributed to these feelings of self-doubt?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah, sure. I've been feeling like I'm just going through the motions at work, and I don't feel like I'm making any progress or contributing to the team in a meaningful way. I've also been comparing myself to my colleagues, who seem to have an easier time picking up new programming skills and getting promoted. It's like I'm stuck in this rut and I don't know how to get out of it.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're feeling a sense of disconnection and frustration with your work, and that's really tough. It's like you're feeling like you're not living up to your own expectations or meeting the standards you have for yourself. Can you help me understand what you mean by going through the motions and what that feels like for you? Is it like you're just doing the same tasks over and over without any sense of purpose or fulfillment?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah, exactly. It's like I'm just doing the same tasks over and over without any sense of purpose or fulfillment. And when I'm doing it, I feel like I'm just going through the motions, like I'm just a robot or something. It's like my passion and creativity have been sucked out of me, and I'm just left with this feeling of emptiness and dissatisfaction.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're feeling a sense of emotional numbness and disconnection from your work, like you're just going through the motions without any sense of joy or fulfillment. Can you help me understand what you think might have caused this sense of disconnection? Was there a specific event or period in your career that marked a shift away from feeling engaged and motivated?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah, I think it might have started when I got my first programming job out of college. I was so excited to be working in the field I loved, but as time went on, I started to feel like I was just doing the same tasks over and over again. There wasn't much room for growth or creativity, and I started to feel like I was just a cog in a machine. And then, when I started comparing myself to my colleagues, I just felt like I was falling behind and couldn't keep up. That's when the self-doubt and feelings of inadequacy really started to set in.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like the initial excitement and passion you had for your work in programming started to wane as you felt like you were getting stuck in a routine and not having opportunities for growth or creativity. And then, comparing yourself to others, you started to feel like you were falling behind and couldn't keep up. Can you tell me more about what that was like for you? How did you feel when you started to realize that you weren't meeting your own expectations or feeling like you were living up to your own standards?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah, it was like I was stuck in this vicious cycle of self-doubt and comparison, and it was affecting my overall outlook on my career and life. I felt like I was constantly struggling to keep up with others, and no matter how hard I tried, I couldn't seem to catch up. It was like I was trapped in this never-ending cycle of inadequacy, and I didn't know how to escape.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like the sense of self-doubt and comparison to others has been really suffocating for you, and it's affected not just your work but also your overall sense of self-worth. Can you help me understand what you think might be the underlying message you're giving yourself in these thoughts of inadequacy and falling behind? What does that mean to you, and what do you think it says about your worth as a person?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah, I think the underlying message I'm giving myself is that I'm not good enough, that I'm not talented enough, that I'm not capable enough. It's like I'm constantly telling myself that I'm falling short, that I'm not meeting expectations, and that's making me feel like I'm worthless.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're telling yourself a very critical and harsh narrative about your abilities and worth as a person. It's like you're constantly beating yourself up over perceived shortcomings and failures. Can you imagine what it would be like if you could reframe those negative self-talk patterns and instead focus on your strengths and accomplishments? How might that change the way you feel about yourself and your abilities?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>It's like, I've been so focused on my perceived shortcomings and failures that I've forgotten about all the times I've successfully completed projects and received positive feedback from my colleagues. I need to start focusing on those strengths and accomplishments instead of dwelling on what I'm not good at.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you've been carrying around a lot of negative self-talk and self-criticism for a long time. It's like you've been beating yourself up over perceived shortcomings and failures, and that's really affecting your self-worth. I want to challenge you to think about this in a different way. What would happen if you started to focus on your strengths and accomplishments instead of your weaknesses? What would happen if you started to celebrate your successes and acknowledge your hard work and abilities? How might that change the way you feel about yourself and your abilities?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think that's a great point, and it's something I've been trying to do, but it's hard to shake off the negative self-talk and self-doubt. I feel like I'm stuck in this cycle of focusing on what I'm not good at, and it's hard to break free from that. But I do want to try to shift my focus to my strengths and accomplishments. Can you help me come up with some strategies for doing that?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're feeling a sense of emotional numbness and disconnection from your work, like you're just going through the motions without any sense of joy or fulfillment.

                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Can you help me understand what you mean by just a cog in a machine and what that feels like for you? Is it like you're just a replaceable part or a mere extension of someone else's vision, rather than a creative and contributing member of the team?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>That's a great way to put it. It's like I'm just a cog in a machine, a replaceable part that can be easily swapped out if needed. It's like I'm just a tool, not a person with my own thoughts, feelings, and ideas. And when I'm just going through the motions, I feel like I'm just a robot, not a human being. I'm not contributing anything meaningful or creative, I'm just following a script, and it's so unfulfilling.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're feeling a deep sense of disconnection and lack of purpose in your work. You're feeling like you're just a cog in a machine, a replaceable part that can be easily swapped out if needed. It's like you're just going through the motions, without any sense of creativity, fulfillment, or contribution. Can you help me understand what you think is missing in your work that's making you feel this way? Is it a lack of autonomy, creativity, or control? Is it a sense of meaning or purpose that's missing?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think I've been missing a sense of autonomy and creativity in my work. As a programmer, I'm used to being able to express myself creatively through code, but in my current job, I feel like I'm just following a script and not really contributing anything meaningful. It's like I'm just a robot, not a human being.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're feeling a deep sense of disconnection from your work and a lack of purpose, autonomy, and creativity. It's like you're just going through the motions, without any sense of fulfillment or contribution. Can you help me understand what you think would need to change in your work or in your approach to your work in order for you to feel more engaged, motivated, and fulfilled? What would need to happen for you to feel like you're making a meaningful contribution and that your work is aligned with your values and passions?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>It's interesting that you bring up the idea of autonomy and creativity, because I think that's exactly what's been missing for me in my work. I used to love programming because it was a way for me to express myself creatively and solve problems in a unique way. But in my current job, I feel like I'm just following a script and not really contributing anything meaningful. It's like I'm just a cog in a machine, not a human being.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're feeling a deep sense of disconnection from your work and a lack of purpose, autonomy, and creativity. It's like you're just going through the motions, without any sense of fulfillment or contribution. Can you imagine what it would be like if you had more autonomy and creativity in your work? Would that make a difference in how you feel about your job and yourself?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think I'm starting to see some patterns in my negative self-talk and self-doubt. I've been focusing on my weaknesses and perceived shortcomings, and that's been making me feel like I'm not good enough. But when I start to focus on my strengths and accomplishments, I feel like I'm more capable and confident. It's like I'm seeing a different picture of myself, one that's more positive and empowering. I think that's what I need to focus on, rather than dwelling on what I'm not good at.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're starting to uncover some important insights about your negative self-talk and self-doubt. It's like you're beginning to see that your focus on weaknesses and perceived shortcomings is actually contributing to your feelings of inadequacy. And that's a really powerful recognition. Can you help me understand what you think is driving this negative self-talk? Is it a habit you've developed over time, or is it a response to specific situations or experiences?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think it's a combination of both. I've always been a perfectionist and I've always had high expectations for myself, so I think that's contributed to my negative self-talk and self-doubt. But at the same time, I've also experienced a lot of negative feedback and criticism from others, especially in my career, and that's probably reinforced my negative self-talk and self-doubt.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Can you help me understand what you think might have caused this sense of disconnection and lack of purpose in your work? Is it a lack of autonomy, creativity, or control? Is it a sense of meaning or purpose that's missing?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>It's really helpful for me to talk about this and explore these patterns and habits I've developed. I think what's been missing for me is a sense of autonomy and creativity in my work. As a programmer, I'm used to being able to express myself creatively through code, but in my current job, I feel like I'm just following a script and not really contributing anything meaningful. It's like I'm just a cog in a machine, not a human being.</div>

                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think I can see how focusing on my strengths and accomplishments could help shift my perspective and build my confidence. It's like, I've been so focused on what I'm not good at that I've forgotten about all the times I've successfully completed projects and received positive feedback from my colleagues. I need to start focusing on those strengths and accomplishments instead of dwelling on my weaknesses.</div>

                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah, that's exactly right. I feel like I'm just going through the motions and not really contributing anything meaningful.
