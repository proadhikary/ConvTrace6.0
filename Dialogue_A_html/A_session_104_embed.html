                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Hi Livia, it's nice to meet you. How are you feeling about being here today?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I'm feeling a bit nervous, to be honest. I'm not really sure where to start.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Can you tell me more about what's been on your mind lately that's making you feel nervous about being here? Is there something specific that's been bothering you or causing you distress?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Honestly, I've just been feeling really overwhelmed with negative thoughts lately. It's hard for me to shake the feeling that everything is going wrong, and I'm constantly worried about what's going to go wrong in the future. I've been trying to focus on the positives, but it feels like they're just being drowned out by all the negative thoughts.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're experiencing a lot of anxiety and worry about the future, and it's making it hard for you to focus on the good things in your life. Can you tell me more about what triggers these negative thoughts? Is there a particular event or situation that started this pattern of thinking, or do you feel like it's just been going on for a while?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah, I think it's been going on for a while, but it's definitely gotten worse over the past few months. I've been trying to pinpoint what's causing it, but it feels like it's just this constant underlying feeling of dread and anxiety. Sometimes I'll have a good day and be feeling okay, but then something small will happen and it's like the whole world comes crashing down on me. It's hard to explain, but it's just this perpetual sense of unease that's hard to shake.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're experiencing a sense of hypervigilance, where you're constantly on the lookout for potential threats or dangers, even when everything seems fine. Can you tell me more about what it's like to have this perpetual sense of unease? Is it like you're walking on eggshells, waiting for something to go wrong, or is it more like you're constantly scanning the horizon for potential problems?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah, it's definitely like I'm walking on eggshells all the time, waiting for something to go wrong. I feel like I'm constantly scanning the environment for potential threats or dangers, even when everything seems fine. It's exhausting, to be honest. I feel like I'm always on high alert, and it's making it hard for me to relax or enjoy things.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like this sense of hypervigilance is really impacting your daily life and making it hard for you to feel comfortable or relaxed. Can you tell me more about how this sense of unease is affecting your relationships with others? Are you finding it hard to connect with people, or are you avoiding social situations because you're worried about something going wrong?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>It's been affecting my relationships, definitely. I've started to withdraw from social situations because I feel like I'm just waiting for something to go wrong or for someone to say or do something that will trigger another negative thought. It's hard for me to relax and be present in the moment because I'm always worried about what's going to happen next.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Can you tell me more about what it's like for you to withdraw from social situations? Is it like you're avoiding certain people or activities, or is it more like you're just not feeling like yourself when you're around others?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>It's a mix of both, to be honest. Sometimes I feel like I'm avoiding certain people or activities because I'm worried about what might happen, but other times it's like I'm just not feeling like myself when I'm around others. It's like I'm carrying this weight of anxiety and worry with me all the time, and it's hard to put on a mask and pretend like everything is okay when it's not.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're feeling really stuck and overwhelmed by this perpetual sense of unease and anxiety. It's like you're carrying a heavy burden around with you all the time, and it's making it hard for you to connect with others or feel like yourself. I want to acknowledge that it takes a lot of courage to share this with me, and I'm here to support you. Can you tell me what you hope to get out of our time together today? What are your goals for our work together, and what do you hope to achieve by coming to therapy?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I guess I'm hoping to find a way to break free from this constant feeling of dread and anxiety. I want to learn how to manage my negative thoughts and feelings of unease so that I can start enjoying life again. I feel like I'm missing out on so much because I'm always worried about what's going to happen next. I want to be able to relax and be present in the moment without constantly worrying about the future.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're hoping to find a way to manage your anxiety and worry so that you can start enjoying life again and feeling more present in the moment. That's a really important goal, and I'm here to support you in achieving it. One thing that might be helpful is to start exploring some of the underlying causes of your anxiety. It sounds like it might be related to a general sense of hypervigilance and a feeling of being on edge all the time. Have you ever experienced any traumatic events or stressors in your life that might be contributing to this feeling?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah, I've definitely experienced some traumatic events in my life. A few years ago, I went through a really difficult breakup with my partner, and it was a really rough time for me. I felt like my whole world was turned upside down, and I was left reeling from the loss. I think that event might have triggered this pattern of negative thinking and anxiety that I'm experiencing now.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like the traumatic event of the breakup has had a lasting impact on you, and it's possible that it's contributing to your current feelings of anxiety and hypervigilance. It's not uncommon for people to experience ongoing effects from traumatic events, and it's great that you're acknowledging the potential connection between the two.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think that's a really good point about the breakup. I've been trying to process that experience for a while now, but it's still really raw for me. I feel like I'm still trying to come to terms with the fact that I lost someone who was so important to me, and it's hard for me to let go of those feelings of sadness and loss. I've been trying to focus on the positive aspects of our relationship, but it's hard for me to see the good when all I can think about is what went wrong.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like the breakup has left a deep scar, and it's understandable that you're still struggling to process your emotions and come to terms with the loss. It's like you're stuck in a cycle of grief and longing, and it's hard for you to move forward because you're still holding onto the pain and sadness of that experience. Can you tell me more about what it's like for you to think about your ex and the relationship you had with them? What are some of the thoughts and emotions that come up for you when you think about them?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah, it's like I'm stuck in this never-ending cycle of pain and longing. When I think about my ex, I feel a mix of emotions - sadness, anger, regret, and even guilt. I keep thinking about what I could have done differently to make the relationship work, and I keep replaying all the memories we shared in my head. It's like I'm trying to relive those moments over and over again, hoping that maybe somehow it would change the outcome. But deep down, I know it won't. I know that no matter how hard I try, I'll never be able to go back and change what happened. And that's what's so painful - the realization that I'll never get to have that relationship again, and that I'll never get to be with that person again. It's like a constant ache in my heart, and it's hard for me to move forward because I'm still holding onto all these emotions.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're carrying around a lot of grief and longing for your ex, and that's making it hard for you to move forward. It's understandable that you're still processing the pain of the breakup, but it's also important to acknowledge that holding onto those emotions is what's keeping you stuck. Can you think of any reasons why you might be holding onto these feelings so tightly? Is there a part of you that's afraid to let go of the past or that's hoping that somehow, someway, things will go back to the way they were?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think I'm holding onto these feelings because I'm scared of what might happen if I let go. I'm scared of moving forward and potentially being hurt again. I'm also scared of losing the memories and emotions I have associated with my ex, because they're all I have left of that relationship. It's like I'm clinging to those memories because they're a reminder that I once felt loved and happy, and I'm afraid to let that go.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're holding onto the memories and emotions of your ex because they represent a sense of happiness and love that you experienced in the past. It's like you're afraid to let go of those feelings because they're a reminder that you once felt loved and connected to someone. Can you think of any ways that you might be able to honor those feelings and memories without getting stuck in them? Maybe we can explore some ways to help you process your grief and move forward in a way that feels authentic and meaningful to you.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think it's good that we're acknowledging the traumatic event of the breakup and how it's still affecting me today. It's hard for me to let go of those feelings, but I can see how holding onto them is keeping me stuck. I'm willing to work on processing my grief and moving forward, but I'm not sure where to start. Can we explore some ways to do that together?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're feeling really stuck and overwhelmed by your emotions, and it's understandable that you're struggling to move forward. One approach we could take is to work on developing a sense of self-compassion and self-awareness. This might involve exploring your thoughts and feelings about the breakup and the relationship you had with your ex, and finding ways to reframe your experiences in a more positive and empowering way. We could also work on developing coping skills and strategies to help you manage your emotions and anxiety, such as mindfulness practices or relaxation techniques. Additionally, we could explore ways to help you rebuild your sense of identity and purpose outside of the relationship. What do you think about trying some of these approaches?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think that sounds like a good plan. I'm willing to try anything at this point. I just want to feel like I can move forward and start enjoying life again. I'm tired of feeling stuck and overwhelmed by my emotions.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're feeling a sense of hopelessness and despair, and it's understandable that you're struggling to find a way to move forward. I want to acknowledge that the breakup was a traumatic event, and it's okay that you're still processing your emotions and trying to make sense of what happened. Can you tell me more about what you think would help you feel more hopeful and optimistic about the future?
